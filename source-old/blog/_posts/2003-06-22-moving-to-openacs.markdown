I'm slowly in the process of moving my site from PHP/MySQL to OpenACS. Things are broken in the meantime. Specifically, I need to import all my old photos, steal [MarkD's](http://badgertronics.com/blog) book module, and implement my family-tree module. If you find something that's broken, feel free to let me know.

I'm currently using an open-source stylesheet from [The NYPL](http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/), but I need to edit it at some point. But for now, at least, it looks better than anything I could drum up by myself.
