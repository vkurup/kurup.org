Cousins Trip 2005 ([photos](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=20907)) was in Lake George, NY this year. The weather didn't quite cooperate this time. It was cloudy and rainy all week. Still, we were able to get in a [great hike](/images/lake-george-hike.jpg), [some competitive bowling](/images/lake-george-bowling.jpg), [basketball](/images/bball.jpg) and mini-golf, not to mention enjoying the [2nd annual Elvis Festival](/images/elvis.jpg). While we didn't run into any bears, we did see [plenty](/images/caterpillar.jpg) [of](/images/gecko.jpg) [wildlife](/images/snake.jpg). Of course, I would be a rumpcake if I were to forget to mention our late-night Taboo contests, the highlight of the trip.
