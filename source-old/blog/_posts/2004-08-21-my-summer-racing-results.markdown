I ran 5 more races this summer in my quest to automatically qualify for next year's [New York Marathon](http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/). The Fifth Avenue Mile was a breakthrough run for me. I easily outdid my pre-race goal of breaking 7 minutes and came within 40 seconds of my best time ever (5:07 fifteen years ago). This makes me think that I might be able to break 4 hours in the marathon next year if I train properly.

Hey Vinod,
</p>

<p>
You are the man!  I am really impressed with the times you are posting
in these races.  Perhaps they will be my motivation to train for
another marathon.  (I was inspired by your efforts in running two
marathons to train for -- and finish! -- Boston 2004.)  I, too, have
the four hour barrier to break.
</p>

<p>
Keep up the strong work!

I'm still so impressed that you finished Boston in that sweltering
heat. I'm praying for a nice cool 40 degree day next November in NYC.
