It's that time of year again - time to reduce my tax bill! Here are the charities that we're donating to this year. I think they're all great causes, so I encourage you to check them out.

- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/about/) - The internet is the most innovative force in our lives and the EFF working to preserve freedom on the net.
- [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) - When [software is free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), it means that we don't have to reinvent the wheel over and over again. That allows developers to focus on more and more interesting problems.
- [American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/) - Too many tragedies this year.
- [Asha for Education](http://www.ashanet.org/index.php?page=about-asha-mission) - A secular group bringing education to the most needy in India
- [World Federalist Movement](http://www.wfm.org/index.php/pages/1) - Supporting the idea of a global community, where countries interact through law and cooperation, not through force.
- [Grameen Foundation](http://www.gfusa.org/about_us/microfinance/) - Helping the world's poorest escape poverty through self-sufficiency
- [WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/) - To support my NPR Podcast habit. I wanted to give directly to [NPR](http://www.npr.org) since I only listen to podcasts and not to the local radio station, but I couldn't figure out a way to donate to NPR on their website.
- Epilepsy Foundation of South Central Wisconsin, American Cancer Society - donations for friends who were raising money.

You can look up most charities on the [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.fourstar.htm) website to see how efficient and organized they are. Most of the ones above received the highest rating, 4 stars.
