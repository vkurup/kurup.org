Geoff organized a
[mini-residency-reunion](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5320)
back in June and somehow scammed Joyce and Howard into hosting it :-)

Manu, Girish, Deepu and I [hiked the Grand
Canyon](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5317) in mid-June. I'm
still not clear who decided it was a great idea to hike down to the
Colorado River and back in [115 degree
weather](/images/high-temp.jpg), but that may be due to the fact that
I fried a good number of my brain cells that day. You may notice that
there are not too many pictures of the hike up...
