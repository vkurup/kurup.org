I ran the [Fitness Magazine 4 mile](http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/70321.2.524689168900021574) race in Central Park last weekend. The remnants of Hurricane Ivan were flooding the streets, so I was certain that the race would be cancelled (or that I would chicken out). Neither happened as the sky cleared 10 minutes before the race started.

I didn't warm up as much as I would've liked, but the first 2 miles went suprisingly well (7:11, 7:16). The hills on mile 3 killed me (7:51), but I was able to pick it up at the end (7:29). I actually thought that I looked pretty good at the finish until I saw the pic posted at the NYRR website:

My Finish Time was 29:47. Here are some more [pics from the race](http://www.nyrrc.org/race/2004/photosa40918.html).

Boy I must be out of shape because I look like that after I walk up a
few flights of stairs. Good for you to be able to still run these
races at your age.

Hey, I'm as old as you are, so watch it with the "old-age" comments
:-) In any case, I'm sure you can still swat a baseball a lot farther
than I can.
