An article in the NY Times claims that ['6 degrees of separation' is an exaggeration](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/science/12MAIL.html). They tested it by asking people to forward emails to people that they knew in hopes that the chain would eventually lead to 1 of the researchers' destinations. I know that I delete any chain mail that I get, so I'm not sure that the study's results are valid. 

Let me provide an anecdotal rebuttal. I went to [Subha and Archana's wedding](http://www.archana-subhasis.us/) in Chicago last weekend and I'm guessing there were 400 people there. I met about 20 people whom I hadn't met before. Of those, 2 had links to me through people who had nothing to do with the wedding. One was a cousin of Sushil, my good buddy from Boston. The other one is a little more convoluted. My cousin Deepu was the inspiration for the name of a musical group when he was at Wash U in St. Louis. Deepu has since moved on to San Fran, so the group has changed its name. A person I met at the wedding is currently a member of that group and has always wanted to meet the infamous Deepu, whose name is plastered over the other members' instruments.

Now, does being connected through a band's name count as a degree of separation?
