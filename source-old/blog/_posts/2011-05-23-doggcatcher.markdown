I talked yesterday about how I didn't like the Google Listen podcast
client. I did a little Googling and found a nice solution (somewhat
ironic, in an Alanis Morrissette kinda way):
[Doggcatcher](http://www.doggcatcher.com/). It costs $6.99 and I spent
an extra $3.99 for [Presto Sound
Library](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.aocate.presto)
which allows you to speed up the podcasts a little. Sorry Merlin! (He
hates when people do this). Doggcatcher seems to do everything I
mentioned as requirements in yesterday's post. I also like that it
doesn't sync between clients, so I can have audio podcasts on my phone
and video podcasts on my gtab tablet. It has a million configuration
options, so you can set certain podcasts as higher priority than
others and you can define how many episodes should be downloaded per
podcast. I love having that kind of flexibility. Most importantly, the
UI has been understandable and every time I launch it, I'm placed
right back at the same place that I left off when I quit.
