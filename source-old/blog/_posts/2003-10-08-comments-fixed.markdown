title: Comments fixed
tags: openacs programming
---

[MarkD](http://badgertronics.com/blog) informed me that unregistered users couldn't add comments. Turns out it was due to some extra quoting of query variables that has been fixed in more recent versions of OpenACS, but I've been too lazy to update. The good news is that all of you who've been dying to tell me off can finally do so!

You shouldn't have fixed the problem these people should take the time
to register with your site and become part of one the coolest
communities on the web.

<p><b>Good point Andy</b></p>

I kinda misspoke - you still have to register. But if you weren't
logged in and you hit the comment link, my site would respond with an
error. That is fixed. So we're still on track to become the coolest
community around :-)

I can feel my coolness quotient rising every day by being associated

Sorry MarkD, but you're clearly slumming it here. Anyone who has had
<a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/01/1636204">a
book reviewed on Slashdot</a> has already reached the pinnacle of
coolness.
