Not all of OpenACS is Postgres 7.3 compliant yet. OpenACS 5 is compliant and the core packages in OpenACS 4.6 are compliant, but some non-core packages haven't been fixed yet. Noncompliant packages will complain:  

    [24/Jun/2003:15:21:36][26623.196621][-conn:kurup::4] Error:  Ns_PgExec: result status: 7 message: ERROR:  Function  pa_collection__new("unknown", "unknown", "unknown", timestamp with time zone,  "unknown", "unknown", "unknown") does not exist
    Unable to identify a function that satisfies the given argument types
    You may need to add explicit typecasts

It is looking for a function with `timestamp with time zone` as one of its parameters, but most OpenACS pl/pgsql functions were defined as accepting `timestamp`. In PG 7.3, `timestamp` means 'timestamp __without__ timezone'. `timestamptz` means 'timestamp **with** timezone'. So, the quick fix, is to change `timestamp` to `timestamptz`.
