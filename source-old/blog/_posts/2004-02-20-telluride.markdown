Sung, Lei, Boris, Mimi and I spent a great week skiing in [Telluride, Colorado](http://www.telluride.com/useful/index.asp). I'm not sure what was better &mdash; learning skiing from the masters in the beautiful Rocky Mountains or eating home-cooked, bacon-laden meals. Not to mention the pecan pie! Here are [the photos](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=14178). Watch [Sung the snowboarder (609 K)](/files/MVI_2266.AVI) and [the crew coming in for lunch (3.5 M)](/files/MVI_2286.AVI).
