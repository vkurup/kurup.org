[MarkD](http://badgertronics.com/blog) informed me that unregistered users couldn't add comments. Turns out it was due to some extra quoting of query variables that has been fixed in more recent versions of OpenACS, but I've been too lazy to update. The good news is that all of you who've been dying to tell me off can finally do so!
