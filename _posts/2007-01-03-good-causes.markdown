I [posted about this last year](http://kurup.org/blog/2005/12/30/good-causes), so here's our updated donation list for 2006. Again, I think they're all great causes, so I encourage you to check them out.

- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/about/) - The internet is the most innovative force in our lives and the EFF working to preserve freedom on the net.
- [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) - When [software is free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), it means that we don't have to reinvent the wheel over and over again. That allows developers to focus on more and more interesting problems.
- [Asha for Education](http://www.ashanet.org/index.php?page=about-asha-mission) - A secular group bringing education to the most needy in India
- [Grameen Foundation](http://www.gfusa.org/about_us/microfinance/) - In the news recently because they were awarded the [Nobel Peace Prize](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/index.html), they help the world's poorest escape poverty through self-sufficiency
- [WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/) - To support my NPR Podcast habit.
- [Ashoka](http://www.ashoka.org/) - Encouraging social entrepreneurs
- [Association for India's Development](http://sahyadri.aidindia.org/content/blogsection/3/67/) - Promoting sustainable development in India
- [World Education](http://www.worlded.org/WEIInternet/aboutus/index.cfm) - world education :)

You can look up most charities on the [Charity
Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.fourstar.htm)
website to see how efficient and organized they are. The ones above
received the highest rating, 4 stars.

<p><b>Thanks From Grameen Foundation USA</b></p>
<p>
Just wanted to thank you personally for your generous donation to GFUSA.
</p>
<p>
This is not an "official" thank your for tax purposes -- you will
receive that via post in the next few days.  I happened upon your blog
after googling your name in an effort to reconcile an old MA address
our database listed for your contact.  Thought it would be neat to
send along an extra thanks!
