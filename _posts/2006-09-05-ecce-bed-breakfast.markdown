Can you believe that it's been a year since [we got married](http://kurup.org/wedding)? Me neither. For our wedding, Mike and Ellie gave us a generous gift certificate to the bed &amp; breakfast of our choice. It took a while to find the right one. We started at bedandbreakfast.com and surfed dozens of listings. This industry really needs some web consulting advice. Most B&amp;B websites don't provide nearly enough information. I want more photos, more reviews. I want to get a feel for the atmosphere.

We finally found a website that showed off those things and made a reservation at [Ecce](http://www.eccebedandbreakfast.com/). We had high expectations, but I'm happy to say that they were exceeded. You won't find more hospitable proprietors than Alan and Kurt. Our [room was tastefully designed](/files/photos/ecce-room.jpg) and was stocked with a gourmet coffee machine, TV/DVD/VCR, fridge and jacuzzi! It was pure luxury. The breakfasts were over the top. Definitely try the french toast with chocolate.

The house sits on a bluff overlooking the Delaware River. The view is amazing. I tried to take one of those panorama pics, but I don't think it does it justice. This place must be breathtaking in the fall. We saw 4 or 5 bald eagles and numerous hawks from the house. We also saw a lot of deer hanging out near the highways.

Tropical Storm Ernesto was winding through the region this weekend, so we didn't do too much in the way of outdoors stuff. We did enjoy the Harvest Festival Market and had some great fried food at the bar at Lackawaxen House. We were less impressed with the Front Porch Cafe, but it was very busy and had gotten good reviews, so maybe we just got unlucky.

So thanks again, Mike and Ellie. I'm certain we never would've otherwise explored this paradise just 2 hours from our front door. And thank you Mala, for the best year of my life (so far!)
