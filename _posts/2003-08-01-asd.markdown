A young guy came in as a walk-in with some mild shortness of breath on exertion and associated chest pain. He was the last patient that I saw during a long, busy day and his symptoms were very mild. I was thinking that maybe he had mild asthma or a respiratory infection, but he didn't look sick at all. Then I listened to his heart. A loud holosystolic murmur throughout with a fixed split S2. Wait, wait. I know this one.... (sounds of my mind clunking along) ASD - [Atrial Septal Defect](http://www.heartpoint.com/congasd.html) ([Patient Information](http://www.ucsfhealth.org/childrens/medical_services/heart_center/congenital/conditions/atrial/signs.html)).

He had his echocardiogram today which confirmed that he had a large ASD (We don't need no stinking echo!). He'll be going to Bellevue for repair and most likely will do very well. I explained everything to him (in Spanish "un agujero in su coraz&oacute;n"). It's times like these that make me glad that I get to do what I do.

Nice pick up!  Are they going to close it percutaneously (i.e. in the
cath lab?)

Unfortunately, we don't have a cath lab here at Metropolitan, so all
of our cards stuff goes to Bellevue, which is kinda like a black
box. Hopefully he'll follow-up soon and with a lot of luck, he may
even come with a procedure report :-)
