I ran the [Fitness Magazine 4 mile](http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/70321.2.524689168900021574) race in Central Park last weekend. The remnants of Hurricane Ivan were flooding the streets, so I was certain that the race would be cancelled (or that I would chicken out). Neither happened as the sky cleared 10 minutes before the race started.

I didn't warm up as much as I would've liked, but the first 2 miles went suprisingly well (7:11, 7:16). The hills on mile 3 killed me (7:51), but I was able to pick it up at the end (7:29). I actually thought that I looked pretty good at the finish until I saw the pic posted at the NYRR website:

My Finish Time was 29:47. Here are some more [pics from the race](http://www.nyrrc.org/race/2004/photosa40918.html).
