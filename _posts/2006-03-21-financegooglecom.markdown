[Google just launched it's new financial website](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/spring-is-season-for-love-and-data.html), [finance.google.com](http://finance.google.com). It combines a lot of information in 1 page and the adjustable graph at the top of a stock's page is just WAY cool. You can focus in on any period of time and see news &amp; reports from that period. They've also added blog posts as a news source.

It's the ideal place to get a quick snapshot of a stock. Lots of information in a very quick-loading page. The major missing item is dividend information. Hopefully it will be there soon.
