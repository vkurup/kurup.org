I sold 3 stocks ([OUTL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=OUTL), [MRINA.PK](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MRINA.PK) and [KBALB](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KBALB)) and bought 5 ([RSC](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RSC), [JAX](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JAX), [EEI](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EEI), [KEYN](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KEYN) and [STS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=STS)).

<table cellspacing="0" summary="Stocks I sold this quarter."> <tr> <th>Sold stocks</th>  <th>Purchased</th>  <th>Total Return</th> <th>Reason for sell</th> </tr>  <tr class="list-odd"> <td>Outlook Group ([OUTL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=OUTL))</td>   <td>Feb 2005</td>  <td>67.65%</td> <td>OUTL is being acquired and taken private at $13.50 per share in a transaction scheduled to close sometime this summer. I decided to sell now at $13.20 rather than wait a few months for an extra 30 cents. The risk is that another acquirer might offer a higher price before the current deal closes. My gut says that won't happen.</td> </tr>  <tr class="list-even"> <td>McRae Industries ([MRINA.PK](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MRINA.PK))</td>   <td>Nov 2005</td>  <td>-12.79%</td> <td>MRINA.PK purposefully delisted because they felt the costs of being a listed company were too expensive. Filing and reporting requirements have increased due to Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and this is taking a toll on a lot of small companies. I've made the decision not to hold delisted companies for a variety of reasons. They're less liquid, so it's harder to get in and out of them. They're subject to fewer reporting requirements, so it's harder to see how they are doing. Most importantly, my standard online sources of financial info don't have much data about delisted companies (Yahoo, Reuters). </td> </tr>  <tr class="list-odd"> <td>Kimball International ([KBALB](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KBALB))</td>   <td>Nov 2005</td>  <td>43.53%</td> <td>KBALB exceeded my market cap cutoff.</td> </tr>  </table>

Here's how the rest of my portfolio is doing as of April 30th, 2006.
