My parents and I went to India for 2 weeks. We spent a couple days in Delhi and then the rest of the time in Kerala. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and actually found the vacation relaxing. Kerala is more beautiful than I ever remember (somehow I seem to forget in between trips). It's lush and green and the food is amazing. I can't wait to go back. Here are [some pics](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5323). Unfortunately, my camera battery died while I was in Kottarakara and I was too dense to bring a 220V converter, so there aren't nearly enough pictures from Kerala.
