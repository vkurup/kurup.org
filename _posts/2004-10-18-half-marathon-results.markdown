I ran 2 more half-marathons in the past couple weeks. I ran [Greta's Great Gallop](http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a41003&amp;result.year=2004) on October 3rd in Central Park and then ran the [Staten Island Half Marathon](http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a41017&amp;result.year=2004) today.

<table> <tr> <th>Date</th> <th>Race</th> <th>Miles</th> <th>Time</th> <th>Pace (min/mile)</th> </tr>  <tr> <td>October 3</td> <td>Greta's Gallop</td> <td>13.1</td> <td>1:46:42</td> <td>8:08</td> </tr>  <tr> <td>October 17</td> <td>Staten Island</td> <td>13.1</td> <td>1:41:56</td> <td>7:47</td> </tr>  </table>

I'm pretty happy about these 2 races. The weather was perfect and I was able to avoid hitting the wall. I improved my half-marathon time about 30 minutes since May. I'm just guessing here, but I probably won't be able to keep this up. The other good news is that this was my ninth NYRR race of the calendar year, so I automatically qualify for next year's NY Marathon (2005).
