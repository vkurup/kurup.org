Stop what you're doing and go buy the July 2006 issue of [Runner's World](http://www.runnersworld.com). Flip to page 49 and read the fine article by Scott Douglas on things a runner should discuss with their physician.

Yep, the "Vinod Kurup" quoted is yours truly! I'm really grateful to Scott for using me as a source and thus making my dream of being in Runner's World come true. :)

Here's the [online version of the article](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,5033,s6-78-0-0-9823,00.html), but go check out the magazine because it's, you know, much cooler.

Also check out [Scott's site](http://www.scottdouglas.biz) for more interesting articles about running.
