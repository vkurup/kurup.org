title: Growing up too fast

I love watching Kavi's expressions. We took the kids to the [Museum of Life
and Science](http://www.ncmls.org/) for a birthday party today. He's been
there plenty of times, mostly with Mala. I've been there a few times with
him. It's one of his (and I guess every kid's) favorite places. Each time
we go, it's a vastly different experience. Everything seems new to him. His
eyes light up with wonder and amazement at the exhibits.

We were late for the party, so Mala took Anika ahead of us while Kavi
dawdled in the front exhibits. Ahead of us was a large skeleton of a
dinosaur's head. I know that he has seen this before, but, it was as if
he'd noticed it for the first time today. And it was scary. Not too scary,
mind you. He wasn't crying or anything. He just was very cautious about
getting too close to it. But, there was no way to avoid it, since the party
room (with the cake!) was just past the dinosaur. He held my hand tightly
and asked what it was. I told him and he repeated it, "Dinosaur?". His eyes
were wide open, but focused on the T-Rex's head. His right hand clenched my
left and when I tried to walk past it, he pulled me back. Still no crying
or complaining, just ... concern. So I took my time and talked to him about
the dinosaur and the other exhibits nearby. Eventually, he mustered up the
courage to walk around the back of the dinosaur and towards the party
room. Later, after the cake and festivities, we made our way back to the
other exhibits. This time, he pointed out the dinosaur, still in a
concerned voice, but made no effort to shy away or slow down. Now, he
noticed other things that he had missed before -- cool astronauts uniforms
and a glass elevator slowly ascending. When he saw each of these things,
his face turned into the embodiment of wonder. Eyes wide open, jaw slightly
ajar. I love seeing him experience life like this, so fully.

I write this because I know that I'm otherwise going to forget them. I had
the distinct feeling this afternoon, while watching him, that he was
growing up in front of my eyes. That these expressions of wonderment would
soon be replaced by the apathy of young adulthood. I know, I know... he's
only 2, but everyone keeps telling me that he will be grown and with kids
of his own before I know it! I hope not and if so, I hope not _too soon_. I
want to make sure that I remember these moments, simply for their own sake.
