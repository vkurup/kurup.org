I built a web application to keep track of my running a couple years ago. I really began using it in earnest during my training for the New York Marathon last year. I've been meaning to make it available for others to use for a long time, but it always seemed like there was a little more work I needed to do on it. While working on it the other day, I noticed the original timestamp on one of the source files: **September 21, 2003** Yikes! That's 2 and a half years ago. Enough is enough &mdash; it's time to let this baby free...

[Hit The Wall](http://kurup.org/run) is officially version 0.2 and available for free use by anyone who wants to keep track of their running. Feel free to look through [my real log (read-only)](http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=16832) or [demorunner's fake log (read-write)](http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=63350) to try it out.

I've created a separate [blog](http://kurup.org/run/blog) and a [forum](http://kurup.org/run/forums/forum-view?forum%5fid=63343) where I'll post updates and respond to questions or comments.
