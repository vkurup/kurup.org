The scripting language used in most of [OpenACS](http://openacs.org) is [Tcl](http://tcl.tk). It doesn't receive a lot of press. When people talk about scripting languages, they mean Perl or Python (and now Ruby). Tcl is not considered in the same category, but it should be. I'm not smart enough to explain why, but Salvatore Sanfilippo is and has written a [gentle introduction to both the basic and powerful features of Tcl](http://antirez.com/articoli/tclmisunderstood.html).
