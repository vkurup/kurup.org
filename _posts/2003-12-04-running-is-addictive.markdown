title: "Running is addictive"

Researchers at my alma mater have shown that [mice who have been bred to run long distances show increased activity in 'craving' regions of the brain when they're denied access to their running wheel](http://www.news.wisc.edu/9208.html) (Be sure to check out the Quicktime video on that page). The addiction of running is physiologically similar to other addictions. Maybe that explains why I was out on the East River Path in 29 degree weather tonight.
