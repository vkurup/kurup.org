Today is the 56th anniversary of [India's Independence from Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%27s_independence_movement). Interestingly, [Google's top results for "indian independence day"](http://www.google.com/search?q=indian%20independence%20day) are not very informative - mostly just greeting card sites.
