[Dan Bern](http://www.danbern.com/) has quickly become one of my favorite musicians. I saw him a while back at the (now defunct) [Bottom Line](http://www.bottomlinecabaret.com/) and then again tonight at Joe's Pub (within spitting distance!). He's been compared to Bob Dylan, although, unlike Dylan, I can understand what he's saying. His music is simple and catchy, and the lyrics can go from hilarious to poignant in one song.

He played a couple songs tonight that I haven't been able to find on CDs anywhere - one called ["One More Light"](http://www.dylanchords.com/others/dan_bern_one_more_light.htm) and one about 9/11. Hopefully they'll be on the "new album" &#8482;
