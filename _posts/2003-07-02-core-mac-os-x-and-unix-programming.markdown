Not only has [MarkD](http://badgertronics.com/blog) produced a [book](http://borkware.com/corebook/), but he's made [SlashDot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/01/1636204) as well. Guess it's about time to retire now...

I'm going to get it eventually, but I'm still working my way through [Cocoa Programming for OS X](http://bignerdranch.com/Book/)
