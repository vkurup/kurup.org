We recently had an "impromptu" family reunion back in Wisconsin which I was
lucky enough to sneak away to.  Here are some pictures - Family reunion

In March '98, after a grueling month in the ICU, I went on a cruise with my
cousins and their parents. I'm currently seriously considering working as a
cruise physician! We went to Freeport and Nassau. The weather and scenery
were beautiful, but my most enjoyable moments were spent discussing old
(and new) times with my cousins at 3:00 AM looking across the unending
ocean.

<p>
It's an experience I hope to repeat soon...

10/22/98: I recently got a letter from my niece, Devi, which broke my heart...
</p>

<blockquote><pre>

Dear Vinu Mamman,

    I visited your page and you didn't put a picture of me. I am really
mad at you because you didn't give me a picture. Why didn't you put a
picture of me? If you don't have a picture of me, I could send you one.
Everybody else have a picture of them. If  you have a picture you can
put it on your computer.

Love,

Devi

<p>
So, Devi, I have a very special picture from our birthday party together in
August. Here it is!
