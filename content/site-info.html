<h3>How this site was built</h3>
<br />
<p> 

This site is hosted at <a
href="http://acornhosting.net">acornhosting.net</a>. They provide each
customer with a virtual machine, so I have almost complete control over my
server. Their prices are reasonable, uptime has been great and they've
always responded to my questions within hours, usually within
minutes. Their <a href="/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=9660">response to a
crisis</a> is also excellent.

</p>

<p>

My virtual server is running <a
href="http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/">Debian unstable</a> which
is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2001/debian-user-200101/msg02106.html">my
server OS of choice</a>. My home computer is a <a
href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html">12 inch Powerbook</a>
running Mac OS X, my client OS of choice. 

</p>

<p> 

This site runs on <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a>, currently
version 5.2.2 <a href="/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=5509">updated
periodically</a>. I make changes and test them on a SVN checkout on my
Powerbook before migrating them to my server. So, yes, my <a
href="/openacs/mac-install">Powerbook runs OpenACS</a>. Read <a
href="http://piskorski.com/docs/cvs-conventions.html">Andy Piskorski's CVS
page</a> for instructions on managing a web project with. I'm using <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> 7.4.5 as my database and <a
href="http://aolserver.com">AOLServer</a> 4.0 as my webserver. I'm using
Pound to proxy requests to various servers I run off the same IP
address. I'm also using a form of virtual hosting built-in to OpenACS
(called host-node mapping) to serve some other dev sites.

<p>

The design of this site was initially a complete ripoff from the <a
href="http://www.nypl.org">NYPL</a>. They <a
href="http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/css/opensource.html">offer free
stylesheets</a> which are tuned to look decent in multiple browsers and
OS's. In August 2003, I finally weaned myself off of them and created my
own design. Well, that's kinda a lie. I took a lot of inspiration from the
<a
href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=033%2F033%2Ecss">Fleur-de-lys theme</a>
by <a href="http://www.tanfa.co.uk/">Claire Campbell</a> at the <a
href="http://csszengarden.com">css Zen Garden</a>. The right-hand links and
the color scheme come from there. I encourage anyone interested in web
design to check out <a href="http://csszengarden.com">css Zen Garden</a> -
the designs are available under the <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/">ShareAlike Creative
Commons license</a> which means that you're free to use them as long as you
keep the CC licensing. A lot of the designs are just drop-dead gorgeous. 

</p>

<p>

The default design in OpenACS 4 is table-based, so I got rid of the tables
in the default template and instead set up divs for each section type - one
for header, main-content, linklist, login-status and footer. This area
still needs work throughout OpenACS. This site should be XHTML and
CSS compliant.
