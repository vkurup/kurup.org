title: Life Update
---


Once again, I've fallen behind on my life updates, so let's get caught up.

- Mala's pregnancy is going well, at least from the husband's point of view. She's due June 15th.
- We drove to Orlando for my CME conference because Delta cancelled our flight. It turned out to be a nice thing because we got to see Puja, Ethan and Loki on the way down and we got to stop in Charleston, SC on the way back. 
- Not to be outdone by Delta, Northwest cancelled my flight to Minneapolis. For those scoring at home, that's 2 consecutive flights cancelled due to "weather"
- Our job search came down to the wire and, in a difficult decision, we chose North Carolina. I'll be working as a hospitalist at [Durham Regional Hospital](http://www.durhamregional.org/) (associated with Duke University) and Mala will be at the [University of North Carolina](http://pediatrics.med.unc.edu/div/endocrin/default.htm).
- We went to Baltimore for Mala's 10 year Hopkins Reunion. I got to see the campus where Mala went to college and we even took in a lacrosse game.
- My brother [Manu started to blog](http://www2.kurup.net/). Yes, this is a thinly veiled jab to get him to update again.
- Puja and Farah threw a wonderful little baby shower for us. It was a lot of fun (yes, I just said that a baby shower was a lot of fun)
- I just got back from a quick trip to North Carolina to find an apartment. We'll be staying at a place called Southpoint Village, assuming that it gets built in time. Everyone please cross your fingers.
- My parents have moved to Dallas, TX, which means that the house I grew up with will be sold. It didn't hit me until just now, but I'll probably never see the inside of that house again.
- We're both beginning to wind down at our current jobs. Mala's fellowship ends in June and my last day is July 10th. We'll move to NC at some point after that.
- They finally turned the A/C on in the building here, which is really nice when the weather is 90+ and your wife is pregnant :)
