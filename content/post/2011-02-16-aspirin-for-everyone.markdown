title: Aspirin for everyone
---


Aspirin is one of those wonder drugs - simple, cheap and effective
versus so many deadly diseases. We know that aspirin prevents heart
attacks and strokes, especially if you've had one before. There is
also some data that it prevents colon cancers, but it was thought that
this effect was only seen when using high doses of aspirin. The
downside of aspirin is that it increases your risk of bleeding,
especially gastrointestinal bleeding (usually from stomach
ulcers). Using *high* doses of aspirin tends to increase the bleeding
risk so much that it offsets any benefits.

When someone has had a stroke or heart attack, using aspirin is a
no-brainer ([secondary prevention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease#Secondary_prevention)). The
question is when to start aspirin in patients who have never had a bad
event ([primary prevention](http://www.enotes.com/public-health-encyclopedia/primary-prevention)). We
used to be much more liberal about recommending aspirin for primary
prevention, but there haven't been many studies which have supported
the practice. The current guidelines state to consider starting
aspirin for primary prevention in men at age 45 and women at age 55,
if their risk of vascular disease outweighs their risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding. That's a wishy-washy way of saying "Leave
it up to your gut." (No pun intended)

I decided to write about this because I saw a recent [study showing decreased deaths from cancer in aspirin users](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144578?dopt=Abstract),
even at **low** doses. Overall cancer rates were 20% lower and
gastrointestinal cancer rates were 35% lower than in people who didn't
use aspirin. These data come from 2 meta-analyses of retrospective
studies, which tend to be a relatively weak type of study. Prospective
studies are much better, but these numbers strike me as significant.

Given this new data, I would strongly favor using aspirin in most
people once they hit those age cutoffs (45 & 55), which for me is
pretty soon. Calculate your [cardiovascular risk](http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp). If your risk
is any more than 10% or so, I would recommend taking an aspirin daily,
possibly even if it's lower. The reasons that I would recommend not
taking an aspirin are if you have frequent stomach ulcers, previous
severe bleeding, or if you're taking blood thinners or high doses of
NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen). Here's a nice [fact sheet](http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/cvd/aspprovider.htm) that summarizes
what I've just rambled about (Wish I had seen that before I wrote all
this!)
