title: My blog is tagged
---


I'm finally getting around to moving my blog into the Web 1.5 world. (2.0 minus javascript). I scrapped the categories system and created a super-simple tags package. So, now I can tag posts and [technorati](http://technorati.com) can find them. OpenACS barely lights up on technorati. Compare [RubyOnRails](http://technorati.com/tag/rails) (20 mentions per day) with [OpenACS](http://technorati.com/tag/openacs) (1 mention in the past month!). I know Rails is popular, but is OpenACS completely dead? I don't think so.
