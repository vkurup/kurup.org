title: OpenACS everywhere

Forget MTV. I want my [OpenACS](http://openacs.org)! So, I finally got around to [install OpenACS on my Powerbook](http://kurup.org/openacs/mac-install). Mostly, I just followed [MarkD's excellent directions](http://borkware.com/rants/openacs/), but I used [tDom](http://www.tdom.org/) and [AOLserver 4](http://aolserver.com/), so there were a few differences.

Vinod...what is the excitment about OpenACS? I went to the website,
but couldn't get a clear idea of what it's differentiating features
are. Are you running OpenACS for this website?
