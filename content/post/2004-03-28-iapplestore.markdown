I caught the tail-end of a free presentation on [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) at the [Apple Store in SoHo](http://www.apple.com/retail/soho/) this afternoon. iMovie has been sitting around unused on my computer for too long. Inspired by how easy the instructor made it seem, I finally got around to launching iMovie and creating this montage of our [Telluride trip (5.0 MB)](http://kurup.org/files/telluride.mov).
