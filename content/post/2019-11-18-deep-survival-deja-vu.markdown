Whenever I come across a book that I want to read, I add it to my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3158304-vinod-kurup) to-read list. This list,
of course, is always growing. I'm very slowly coming to terms with the fact that I will never make
it through this list and that someday I will die, with unread books on my to-read list. Horrors! The
other major problem with this simple approach to a reading list is that I can never remember why I
added a book to my list. If it was a recent addition, I might recall, but in most cases I just can't
remember why I wanted to read the book in the first place. 

In that way, the book Deep Survival made it to my to-read list last year, and I picked it up for my
Kindle when it went on sale recently:

I've gotten through the first few chapters so far. I have been enjoying it, but something about it
is bothering me. It felt very *familiar*. Maybe that is what happened... I read a teaser for the book in
a magazine article or something, and that is why I added it to my to-read list last year.

And then yesterday, while I was converting the blog from Octopress to Hugo, I had to fix up some
posts, so I ended up looking through a bunch of my old posts, including.... [my book review of Deep Survival](/blog/2007/04/15/deep-survival/).

It's a weird feeling to read a review about a book that I've been wanting to read for over a year,
written by a 12 year younger version of yourself.
