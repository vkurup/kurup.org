title: Facebook is killing blogging
---


Looks like August 18th was
International-Prominent-Bloggers-Complain-About-Facebook-Killing-Blogging
Day. I was just [two weeks too early](http://www.kurup.org/blog/2012/08/03/blogging-again/).

- Tim Bray: [Blogodammerung](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/08/18/Blogodammerung)
- Scott Hanselman: [Your words are wasted](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx)
- Jon Udell: [Where have all the bloggers gone?](http://blog.jonudell.net/2012/08/10/where-have-all-the-bloggers-gone/)

On a side note, I'm really enjoying Scott Hanselman's podcast [This Developer's Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/). It's an homage to
the awesome [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org), but
focused on programming issues. They interview interesting programmers,
but they carefully edit the interviews to focus on the parts that are
the most interesting, interspersing them with music and effects. It's
really well done.
