* [Old people can build muscle](https://peterattiamd.com/muscle-fiber-shape-and-resistance-training/). Sorry,
this one is behind a paywall, but it basically describes a study that showed that muscle
SFI decreased in old people (ages 60-79) with resistance training. Muscle SFI (shape
factor index) represents how close the cross-sectional shape of your muscle is to the
shape of a circle, where 1.00 is a circle and the lower the number, the better it is.
I'd never heard of that metric before. But the good news is that in this study, both
young and old people were able to decrease their SFI by the same amount over the study
period.
