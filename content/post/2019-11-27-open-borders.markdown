I just finished [Open Borders](https://amzn.to/35FoTXV), a graphic novel about immigration policy.
(Not 2 things that normally occupy the same sentence)

It was an excellent presentation of a position that I've always felt to be morally correct, in my
heart of hearts. I am one of the few lucky ones who gets to be an American citizen just because of
the fact that my parents took it on themselves to forge a better life for us. Why shouldn't everyone
have this opportunity? This book shatters many of the myths that allowing open borders makes things
"worse" in any way for natives.
