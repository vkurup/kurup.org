I set up an OBi110 device to provide a landline at home. OK, it's not a land line, it's
a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) line, but it performs a similar function. We've
always had a landline. Our cell phone coverage is spotty at times and ever since Mala
started working from home, she needs to have a reliable phone line for her global
conference calls.

The problem is that Spectrum was charging us $44.95 per month plus taxes, which took it
near $50 every month. I considered a few options including:

* MagicJack
* Ooma
* I looked at a few others... can't remember them all

In the end, I settled on buying an [ATA device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_telephone_adapter) and then connecting it
to a cheaper VOIP service. I chose [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) which has been great so
far.

One Time Costs:
* [OBi110](https://amzn.to/2EivFuP) ATA device: $19.90
* voip.ms setup fee: $0.40
* voip.ms e911 setup fee: $1.50

Monthly Costs:
* voip.ms fee for an incoming phone number: $0.85
* voip.ms e911 monthly fee: $1.50

Per-Minute Costs:
* voip.ms incoming: $0.009 per minute

I'll have to keep an eye on my monthly per-minute costs because there is an unlimited
plan that is $4.25 per month, which I'll switch to if I use more than that per month. In
any case, this is MUCH cheaper than Spectrum.

Now, if you do any research about the OBi110 device, you'll see everyone telling you not
to buy it because it is out of service and doesn't support Google Voice. This is true,
ObiTalk doesn't support the device anymore. When it was supported by the company, you
could just dial a special code on your phone and it would do all the set up for you.
Since it's not supported, that procedure doesn't work anymore. But you can [manually configure the device](https://wiki.voip.ms/article/OBi_100/110_%26_OBi_200) with the
excellent docs from voip.ms, and for a geek like me that was not bad. And yes, you can't
link a Google Voice number to the device, but I didn't want to do that anyway. I think
if you wanted to keep using a google voice number, you could probably get pretty close
by putting a different number on your device (through voip.ms) and then pointing Google
Voice at that number. Incoming calls would work fine in that way, but I'm not sure about
outgoing calls. If you want to seamlessly use Google Voice on an ATA device, then OBi110
isn't for you. You'll need the OBI202 (which was out of stock when I was looking).
