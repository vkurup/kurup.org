title: Getting some clojure
---


Steve Yegge is one of my favorite bloggers. I read ["You Should Write Blogs"](http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) a
long time ago and it is one of the main reasons that I still try to keep
this blog going at all. He recently took a blogging hiatus and in his
[return post](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2010/07/blogger-finger.html),
he left a little hint that he was interested in a programming language
called [clojure](http://clojure.org).

My programming skills have been rusting away (Darn those patients, always
getting sick and stuff!), so I've been looking for a little
inspiration. I'm hoping that clojure is it. I've always wanted to learn
lisp. I know a little elisp and scheme, but I've never gotten comfortable
with them. Clojure compiles code that runs on a JVM (java virtual
machine). This gives you a lot of the "power" of java, namely the extensive
libraries and the widespread platforms on which it will run. But instead of
having to write java, you get to write in a dynamic, lisp-like language. At
least that's how I understand it.

Specifically, I hope that I'll eventually be able to create applications
that run on android phones, which is a java environment. Smartphones are
clearly going to be a huge part of the future, if not **the way** of the
future. I don't see myself ever buying an iPhone and Mala already has a
Droid Eris that I'd be able to play with if I needed. (Didn't tell you
that, did I Mala?) So... Android it is.

Starting today, I'm going to start reading about clojure and taking notes
(and maybe even posting them!). I've never been very good about taking
notes, ever in my life. But, I clearly [need to learn](http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/03/how-to-brain-dump-what-you-know/).
