I had dinner with a friend of mine whom I hadn't seen in a few
months. Turned out that she had been mugged in the lobby of her
apartment in Hell's Kitchen, so she's spent the last few months moving
to a safer neighborhood and dealing with all the pain that goes along
with that. How sobering. Thanks to self-defense classes that she took
in college, she was able to ultimately fight off her attacker by
pushing him away just long enough for her to scream for help. 

>You can't scream when he's pressed up against you.

The bastard actually impersonated a police officer in order to get
access to her building. Her one piece of advice for me (or anyone) -
"Learn some self defense," and blowing away any myths I might have
believed, "Men are targets as often as women because they tend to have
more money on hand."
