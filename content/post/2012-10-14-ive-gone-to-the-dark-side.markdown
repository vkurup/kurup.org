title: I've gone to the dark side
---


I was a huge Apple fan growing up and IBM was Apple's enemy. Buying an
IBM computer would have been unthinkable.

Well, the unthinkable has happened. Of course IBM doesn't make laptops
anymore, but their computers live on under the Lenovo name. I am the
proud owner of a new [Lenovo Thinkpad T420S](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t420s). I
love this computer. It's an ugly black boxy thing, but it's light (4
lbs), quiet and speedy. And the keyboard is just pure awesome. That's
the main reason that I bought the T420S as opposed to the current T430
line. The new line has the chicklet keyboard that is being used on all
laptops these days. The T420 is the last one with the old-fashioned
clicky keyboard, which I love.

I also feel very lucky to get the deal that I got. I bought it from
[Lenovo's Outlet store](http://outlet.lenovo.com), which had about
thirty T420s's in stock when I was shopping. This one was about half
the price of the others, by my estimation. It's so underpriced that
I'm wondering if I'm missing an obvious flaw, but I don't see it.
(Please let me know if you do!)

Here's a comparison between the specs of my computer compared to one
that was available at the Outlet store on October 4th, 2012:

The RAM is better on the other model, but Windows 7 Professional is an
upgrade on my model. I don't really understand why mine was so cheap,
but I'm pretty happy about it!

I added another 4G of RAM, moved Windows to a VirtualBox image and
installed Arch Linux with Xmonad. It takes about 10 seconds to get
from the BIOS screen to a working computer. I'll post some info on my
setup in a future post.
