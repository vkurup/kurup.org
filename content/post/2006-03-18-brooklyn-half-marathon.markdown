title: Brooklyn Half Marathon
---


It was cold out there today. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, a headband and gloves, and I was still cold. I doubted whether I'd be able to break 2 hours, like I'd hoped. A mile into the race I was sure I wouldn't be able to do it. It felt like I was just running in place. As usual though, I eventually warmed up and felt pretty good.

I planned to take the first 5 miles real easy and I came through in 47:28. Not bad. I wanted to do the next 5 miles in 45 minutes. I came through in 45:41. Not  bad. Finally, I wanted to really pick it up the last 5K (3.1 miles). I came through in 26:43, about 8:30 pace. Again, not bad. The last 3 miles seemed like it was all hills. Even the finish was on a hill! I finally saw the finish line, checked my watch and saw 1:59:13, and promptly took off like a crazy person.

Final tally: 1:59:52!

This is the first time I ran Brooklyn and I really liked it. We started on the boardwalk at Coney Island and ran along the beach for about 3 miles. Then, there was a long straight road stretch for about 5-6 miles and we finally finished with a few loops inside Prospect Park. They just need to flatten out some of those hills...

Hey, looks like you made substantial headway since Manhattan half,
that's great.  Nice race report.  And don't worry about the hills; the
more you run them, the less high they seem.  (I'm lying of course!)
that's my home training ground, so they seem like predictable friends
to me...

<p>
see you at Bronx Half I hope.

Lucky you - It must be nice to train in Prospect Park. I love the
Bronx, but I haven't found a dependable course yet. I'm a mile away
from Van Cortlandt park, but it doesn't have any runner-friendly loops
like Prospect Park or Central Park. But it does have hills - I guess I
should work there a bit more, huh?

My Manhattan time is misleading because I didn't train at all for
it. I was expecting the Manhattan half to be in August like it was
last year, so I was slacking off in my running :-)

How'd you do? See ya at the Bronx!
