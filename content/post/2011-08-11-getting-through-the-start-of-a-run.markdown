title: Getting through the start of a run
---


I love running. Wait, that's a lie. I love running after I've finished
my run. I also love it during those periods where I get my runner's
high, usually around the 30 minute mark, but often it happens multiple
times after that point. I **don't** love running when I'm
contemplating going for a run. There are rare occasions where I'm just
itching to go for a run, but usually I'm only able start a run by
forcibly suppressing the compelling rationalizations that my brain
develops. My brain is really good at finding reasons not to run. One
trick that seems to work is to tell my brain that I have the right to
turn around when I get to the mailbox at the end of the driveway. Of
course, once I've done the mechanics of getting my shoes and starting,
I never turn around. My brain is so gullible.

I also don't love my run during the first 10 to 15 minutes. Those are
always a struggle. Always. Stretching beforehand makes it less of a
struggle, but I hate stretching, so I rarely do that. I have a few
techniques to get myself through the beginnings of my runs. 

1. **Count**: Just count from 1 to 100. Once you get to a hundred, start
over. This one works the best. That's why it's first!
2. **Mantra**: Repeat a mantra to yourself. My favorites are: *Keep
covering ground* (inspired by my favorite running book, [Once a Runner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0915297019/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=vinodkurupshomep&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0915297019)) and *Just keep swimming*

3. **Food**: Start thinking about what I'm going to eat after the
run. OK, this rarely helps, but I can't stop thinking about it.
4. **Slow**: If I'm really feeling sluggish, then I force myself to slow
down. As I've mentioned before, [running slow](/blog/2009/09/22/running-slow/) is probably the most important
running technique I have. It's counter-intuitive, but it always
work. Running slower than I think I should always makes the run go
faster than I thought it would.
5. **Shorten**: Shorten your stride. I aim to get 3 strides per
second, which seems really quick to me. In order to do that I shorten
my stride. I think most runners would benefit from a shorter
stride. It automatically improves your form.

Basically, all of these are tricks to get your mind to focus on
something else besides the pain of the run. One thing that also helps
is to listen to music or podcasts. It works by the same principle of
getting your mind off the pain, but I found that my best runs were
always the ones where I left the iPod at home. It certainly makes the
beginning of the run harder, but it frees my brain up to really listen
to my body. I would otherwise find myself adjusting my pace to the
beat of the music, rather than to the pace that my body naturally
wanted to go. I also tend to have my deepest thoughts (don't laugh!)
when I'm running and having music pumped in would drown those out. I
consider it my meditation practice, since I suck at real
meditation. Finally, it's a safety issue. When running in the woods,
you never know what kind of creature will attack:

Take my advice for what it's worth... running advice from a part-time
runner who is slower than molasses. I'd love to hear any other running
tricks you have!
