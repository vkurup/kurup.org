title: Growing a Business
---


I read this book in 2005, but never posted this review. So here it
is...

## <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671671642?ie=UTF8&tag=vinodkurupshomep&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0671671642">Growing a Business</a> by Paul Hawken

This is an honest and practical guide to running a business. I don't
remember where I first heard about this book. Maybe [Lars](http://pinds.com)?

It was written in 1987. Hawken talks about building a business. It's
often portrayed as a heroic or glamorous endeavor, but really it's
not. It's a lot of hard work, but also a lot of common sense. He spends a
chapter talking about a quality that you need to be successful in your own
business. He calls it Tradeskill.

It's like intuition, for business. He says its something you can't acquire
easily, except perhaps in childhood. People that were drawn into business
activities at a young age have it. Those that weren't, don't. And no amount
of book-smarts can make up for the lack of Tradeskill. If you're not
comfortable haggling in a flea market, you should think twice about going
into business. Instead, he recommends dipping your feet in the water,
without starting a business yourself. Take a part time job in a business
that you're interested in and try to take on as many roles as possible in
that business.

Another theme in his book is the wisdom of growing slowly. Having too much
money while starting a business is worse than no having enough. It's
something I read a lot now (Arsdigita, Paul Graham, 37Signals), but it's
interesting to see it written way back when as well.

### Things I learned from this book

## It's probably not for me

Starting your own business is not for everyone. It takes a temperament that
isn't easily learned. I don't think I have Tradeskill. I'm not going to let
that stop me from learning about business, but I'm going to be a little
more thorough in my planning and preparation if I ever do it.

## The 5-15 report is a good idea

He mentions something called a 5-15 report. it's a report that every
employee in a company should have to write **every** week. It should take
less than 15 minutes to write and less than 5 minutes to read. Part I is a
progress report for the week, Part II is a report on the morale of the
department and Part III is one idea to make the company better. I like the
idea of a weekly low-commitment progress report.

## Overstaffing is the root of all evil

A major problem of big business is over-staffing. Once an employee
learns that their work is redundant, or requires little effort, they
realize their job is expendable and that they must spend all their
time preserving their job - through hijacking credit, office politics,
etc. The basic result is that **people hoard information**. Information
that, if freely disseminated, would allow the company to function
better. If I have useful information that other employees don't have,
then I am valuable. Understaffed companies (start-ups) work in the
opposite way. I have enough work as it is, so I'm happy to share
information with you, because perhaps it will allow you to help me out
with my workload. The company becomes more efficient. I see this
effect of over-staffing where I work (although I didn't recognize it
as such until reading this book)

### random quotes / concepts from the book
 
Flat management/employee structures are good. Trust the people you work with and
give them wide latitude.

Problems are opportunities - dive into them.

"A good business has interesting problems. A bad business has boring ones." (p. 39) 

Have a partner. You shouldn't ever think of going it alone.

"Being in business is not about making money. It is a way to become who you are." (p. 19)
