If you're going to visit Italy, I believe that these three tips will make you have an amazing trip.

First and foremost, visit Florence, Rome, Venice, and Cinque Terre. Florence has delicious food and the best gelato out of all of these places. Rome has the best pizza and the colosseum and the forum are important and fun sites to see. In Venice they have great pasta and seafood and a lot of places to ride on boats.

Secondly, donâ€™t use cars to get around the city. Cars are difficult to use because there are a lot of one way roads and confusing traffic lights. You will enjoy walking or going on a bike tour more. You can also use the train for longer distances.

Lastly, you have to have pizza, pasta, and gelato every day. Pizza in Italy has a crunchier crust and they put a ton of cheese. When you order pasta the bowl is so big, but there is a small hole in the middle that is filled with pasta. It is way more than you think. I recommend the pasta bolognese. Italian gelato is fresh and inexpensive. You can get 2 flavors in a cup for $2.50!

Clearly, Italy has fantastic sights to see and food to eat. If you follow these 3 tips you will have a great trip!
