title: Night shifts

Well, I'm gonna be here in Green Bay for a little while longer,
probably until Thanksgiving. So far, I've been working mostly night
shifts, bringing back vivid memories of 'night float' during
residency. Overall, I'm really enjoying it. Everyone's really nice and
welcoming. It's quite a change from residency when you're the low man
on the totem pole. The patient population is more primary care
oriented. I've seen one transplant patient so far, wheras I used to
see almost one-a-day in residency. I couldn't think of a better way to
transition from residency into real-life...
