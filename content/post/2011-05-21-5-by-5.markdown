My commute to work is 25 minutes each way, so I'm always looking for a
podcast to listen to. I've been a fan of the
[43folders](http://43folders.com) website for years and Merlin Mann
recently started a podcast called [Back To Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w)
with Dan Benjamin. Dan Benjamin, it turns out, is the founder of a
network called [5by5](http://5by5.tv/), which he says has been called
"NPR for geeks". The shows I've listened to have all been sharp and
entertaining so far. I especially like [Latest in Paleo](http://5by5.tv/paleo/16) (despite the fact that I'm not eating
anything near a Paleo diet) and the Pipeline (check out the interview
with [Philip Elmer-DeWitt](http://5by5.tv/pipeline/49)). Looking
through the list of shows, I can only believe that Dan Benjamin has to
be the most productive person on the face of the earth.

I'm currently also listening to [All About Android](http://twit.tv/aaa), [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) and some [UC-Berkeley CS lectures](http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978271). Any
other great podcasts I'm missing?
