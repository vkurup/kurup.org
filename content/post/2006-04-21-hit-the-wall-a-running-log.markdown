title: Hit The Wall (a running log)
---


I built a web application to keep track of my running a couple years
ago. I really began using it in earnest during my training for the New
York Marathon last year. I've been meaning to make it available for
others to use for a long time, but it always seemed like there was a
little more work I needed to do on it. While working on it the other
day, I noticed the original timestamp on one of the source files:
**September 21, 2003** Yikes! That's 2 and a half years ago. Enough is
enough &mdash; it's time to let this baby free...

[Hit The Wall](http://kurup.org/run) is officially version 0.2 and
available for free use by anyone who wants to keep track of their
running. Feel free to look through [my real log (read-only)](http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=16832) or
[demorunner's fake log (read-write)](http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=63350) to try it
out.

Cool little tool Vinod, but after reading the reference on the Wall
and how to avoid it I have some alternative names:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't Hit The Wall - A Running Log</li>
<li>Avoiding The Wall - A Runner's Log</li>
<li>Going Through Walls - Running Log</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

Good point. I just thought 'Hit The Wall' sounded catchy. And it works
in the same vein as FSF's text pager being named 'less' (rather than
'more'). Get it? :-)
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, it's better than the previous name I had in mind,
which was 'Running Log".
