title: Some Emacs Posts
---

A few cool Emacs posts have flown across my radar, so I'm noting them here for that time in the
future when I have time to play with them.

* [Get unicode glyphs to show properly](http://endlessparentheses.com/manually-choose-a-fallback-font-for-unicode.html). (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
* [Creating slides with org-mode and Reveal.js](http://jr0cket.co.uk/2013/10/create-cool-slides--Org-mode-Revealjs.html/).
  Finally, a sane way to create a presentation :)
* [Anzu](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu): Improves incremental search. Anzu shows the number
  of matches found, and how many matches remain in the document.

* [Emacs as a Django IDE](http://from-the-cloud.com/en/emacs/2013/01/28_emacs-as-a-django-ide-with-python-djangoel.html):
  I tried this out briefly, but didn't end up sticking with it. It seemed too heavyweight.
  I'm probably just too used to my own workflow. I still think it's an interesting idea and would
  like to try it again sometime.
* [Travel back and forth in git history](http://emacsredux.com/blog/2014/07/22/travel-back-and-forward-in-git-history/):
  I'm addicted to [magit mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Magit), to the point that the
  only git command I use manually nowadays is `git clone`. I do everything else in magit. Magit has
  a `magit-blame-mode` which shows when each line in a file was changed and by whom.
  `git-timemachine` seems to take that a step further by visiting each revision, one by
  one. I can think of a few times where that would have been useful.
* [Search StackOverflow from inside Emacs](https://github.com/omouse/emacs-sos): Enough said.
* [Emacs RSS client](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed): Still using NewsBlur, but totally miss
  Google Reader. Maybe I need to try this one out.
* [Sacha Chua's minicourse on Elisp](http://sachachua.com/blog/series/read-lisp-tweak-emacs/): Have
  to read through this someday!
