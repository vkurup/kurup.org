I moved my blog from Octopress to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) today. I had been [slightly unhappy
with Octopress for a while now](https://kurup.org/blog/2014/07/22/pygments-on-arch-linux/), but
mainly I just wanted something new to play with. Hugo is MUCH faster than Octopress was:

```bash
vkurup@caktus020:~/dev/kurup.org(master) $ hugo

                   | EN   
+------------------+-----+
  Pages            | 669  
  Paginator pages  |  29  
  Non-page files   |   0  
  Static files     | 426  
  Processed images |   0  
  Aliases          |   1  
  Sitemaps         |   1  
  Cleaned          |   0  

Total in 808 ms
```

It is nice to generate my entire site in less than a second. 

But I still liked the style and theme of my old site, so I was happy to find that [someone had
already built an Octopress theme for Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-octopress/). I promptly
stole his work and customized a few things here and there to make it look (nearly) exactly like my
old site did. Yay! Thanks to [Parsia](https://parsiya.net/) for building that theme. I've also
subscribed to his RSS feed because his site looks pretty interesting.

Moving my content wasn't easy, but it wasn't hard. I mainly just copied the old markdown posts over,
changed the front matter, and then fixed a few octopress plugins I was using to work with Hugo. 

Future steps:

- Switch from Disqus to something self-hosted
- Generate the HTML on the server rather than having the HTML in git
- Update my About page and Computers page
- ... oh, maybe write more!
