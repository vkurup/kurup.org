title: My first OpenACS port
---


I finished porting the homepage module from
[ACS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArsDigita) to
[OpenACS](http://openacs.org/). Actually, it had already been ported,
but the ACS version changed substantially, so I guess I merged the new
ACS version with the old OpenACS version. Anyway, it works! Here's the
