<p><b>The Nigerian SCO Connection</b></p>

There is a great parody of the nigerian scam spam letter crossed over
with SCO over at <a

I am very annoyed with these "johnny come lately" types who are trying
to claim stake to internet technologies *after* they are already
mature. It's like the company that tried to lay claim to
<em>hyperlinks</em>, even though xerox showed the technology back in
the 60s, or the recent claim by another company that claims it owns
the technology for embedding things like Flash, movies, etc as part of
the web browser. Where were these claims when the technologies were
developing???
