title: Girish is published!
---


My cousin Girish was interviewed for an article about hormone
replacement in heart disease on Rx.com. Unfortunately Rx.com has gone
kaput and the author doesn't want me to publish the article here, so
it's no longer available. Take my word that it was interesting and
Girish sounded really smart!
