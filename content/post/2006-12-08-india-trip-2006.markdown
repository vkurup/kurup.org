I was fortunate to take a [trip with my in-laws to India](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album%5fid=80449) last month. I've finally gotten around to uploading the pics, but as I look at them now, they don't quite capture the amount of amazing stuff that we saw. I took about 400 pictures and uploaded 187 here. You'd think 400 pics would adequately capture a trip, but not for a trip to India.

Here are some interesting ones in case you don't want to wade through 15 pages of pics.
