Title: [Red Team Blues](https://amzn.to/4bpWd8y) by Cory Doctorow

Subtitle: A Martin Hench Novel

Why: I like his blog and saw this book recommended somewhere

Review:

Four stars. The main character Marty is a 67 year old forensic accountant who has spent
his career breaking into financial systems for his clients. There is one gruesome scene
early in the book, which is sometimes enough to make me drop a book, but fortunately the
story didn't go in that direction much. Doctorow does a great job with the
cryptocurrency and modern technology aspects of the story, at least to my eye.

It was a fun read, and I'm looking forward to the other books in the series, especially
the one that is set back in the 90s.
