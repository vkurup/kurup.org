title: Mala's Bolognese

{{< imgcap src="/images/pasta.jpg" title="Mala's Bolognese" >}}

I have just had the most amazing Italian meal that I've had outside of
Roberto's in the Bronx. Mala made fresh homemade Pappardelle and a
Bolognese sauce that she just learned at
[Revolution's](http://www.revolutionrestaurant.com) cooking class. The
thing is, she made this yesterday, and I just tried it today as
leftovers and it was still amazing. This sure is going to make going
lo-carb impossible.
