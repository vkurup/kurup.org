All I could think of while watching the news about the supercomputer
[Watson](http://www-943.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/) beating humans
at Jeopardy was how this could be used in medicine. Looks like [I'm not alone](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=paging-dr-watson-ibm-to-apply-jeopa-2011-02-17).

Time to start looking for a new job?
