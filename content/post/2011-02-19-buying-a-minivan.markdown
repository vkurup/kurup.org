title: Buying a Minivan
---


The time comes in every man's life where he eventually has to break
down and buy a minivan. That time has come. The [Altima is on it's last legs](/blog/2011/02/04/i-retract-my-previous-tweet) and we really
need a vehicle which can seat our whole family plus a couple visitors
plus luggage. Only a minivan fits those requirements.

I'll probably wait until the spring to buy. That's when the annual
Consumer Reports auto issue comes out. In the meantime, I'm doing some
preliminary research. The Honda Odyssey seems to get the best reviews,
but it's also the most expensive. The Toyota Sienna isn't far behind
on reviews (or on price) and is the only one that comes with AWD. If
the controls on the Sienna are similar to our current RAV4, then that
would simplify life. On the other hand, I'm not happy that our RAV4
alternator died just a month out of it's warranty. The Kia Sedona gets
decent reviews and is **much** cheaper, but at the expense of
questionable reliability and poor resale value (which might make it
worthwhile to buy gently used). Finally, the dark horse is the
Mazda5. It was the top rated minivan by Consumer Reports last year
though I hardly ever see one on the roads. It is significantly smaller
than the others, but it's cheaper and gets much better
mileage. Reviews claim it can seat 7 adults without too much
squeezing. We'll have to test drive each of them, but I would *love*
it if the Mazda5 fit our requirements.

Philip Greenspun recently posted an [entertaining review of the 2011 Honda Odyssey](http://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/cars/honda-odyssey-review). It's
a favorable review, but includes quite a few bits of Greenspun's
biting humor. My favorite was this comment about the lack of progress
in automotive technology:

>Suppose that you're a sleep-deprived mother. Your infant is sleeping in the middle row of seats and you've forgotten all about him. You go into a store and leave him to bake in the Odyssey's greenhouse of glass. The child starts to cry. The Odyssey has a sensitive microphone as part of its telephone Bluetooth interface. The Odyssey's computer system is always on, waiting for a radio signal from the remote control. The Odyssey has multiple interior temperature sensors for the automatic climate control system. Does the Odyssey's always-on computer have enough logic to say

        IF child crying in interior 
           AND car is parked and off 
           AND interior temperature is above 100 degrees
        THEN
           roll windows down
           send text message to owners

>? No. In fact, the Odyssey's computer will happily sit there, with all of its sensors telling it "a child is being roasted to death", and do nothing.

Maybe someday our cars will be as smart as our phones. Anyone else
have advice on a great minivan?
