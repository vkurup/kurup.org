Life update time. If you're a keen follower of this site, you'll have noticed the little box in the upper left hand corner announcing my [wedding to Mala](http://kurup.org/wedding). We got married a few months back and it was documented in photos by [friends, family](http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17012) and even [an official photographer](http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17010). (Time wasting warning: There are 500 pictures from friends and family, 1200+ proofs from our photographer).

My brother Manoj created a touching slide show which had our guests laughing and Mala and I cringeing. That hasn't made it to the website yet, but negotiations with the concerned parties are in progress ("C'mon Mala, it's not that embarrassing!"). We can't thank enough the people who made our wedding day magical. It was, without question, the happiest day of my life.
