I can't seem to find things on the web as well as I used to. I blame [Google being
enshittified](https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi), but
whatever the reason, I'm going to post links here. Not sure of the tempo or format but I
guess I'll figure that out.

* [Lydiard Lacing](https://www.nike.com/a/running-shoe-lacing-techniques). I've been having trouble with my toes and someone mentioned that
  changing my lacing might help. I've tried Lydiard Lacing for a few weeks and it gives
  my toes a lot more room. I fear that Nike link will
  eventually rot, so here's [another explanation](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/straightbarlacing.htm).

* [Big Three](https://www.chirocentre.com.au/stuart-mcgills-big-three-low-back-exercises/). Three exercises I've been doing for my back

* [RockAuto](https://www.rockauto.com/) -  An alternative to Amazon for car parts. I
  needed wiper blades, so checked where [reddit recommended to buy them](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/m85oc8/whats_your_favorite_website_to_buy_parts_from_and/)
  and also [which brand to buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/120synn/any_good_wiper_blades/).

* [MediaCMS](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/pagkh8/mediacms_a_modern_fully_featured_open_source/) -
  Someday I'd like to try this out for all the family photos and videos we have.
