We treated ourselves to our favorite New York Pizza today - Louie and
Ernie's. In my mind, it's the perfect pizza. The thin crust is crispy
on the bottom, and chewy on the top. There's plenty of cheese and the
sauce has some flavor. The only problem with this place is that it's
nowhere near public transportation and they don't deliver. It's
probably a good thing though, or we'd be eating this ALL the time.
