Title: [CivilWarLand in Bad Decline](https://amzn.to/3PQopIg) by George Saunders

Why: A co-worker recommended and I vaguely remember liking Lincoln in the Bardo

Review:
It is a series of short stories, all with the thread of being set in various near-future dystopias with flawed characters. It's definitely on the weird/absurd side of things. Parts of it reminded me of The Stand or Station 11, two books I really liked. Parts were humorous and parts were absolutely disgusting, but throughout, it shed a light on human nature, even in those weird circumstances. I wouldn't read it again, but I'm glad it and I added Pastoralia to my to-read list.
