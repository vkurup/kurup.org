I was born in Columbus, Ohio, but my parents moved to Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin when I was about 2 years old. Hence, I am forever a 
cheesehead!!! My family still lives in Wisconsin. Thanks to my 
brother and sister (and my brother-in-law and sister-in-law, of 
course), I have 6 beautiful and wonderful nieces and nephews. Being
here on the east coast, I miss them very much and I can't wait to go
home and see them again. I've started to put some pictures of them 
on my <a href="/content/family">Family</a> page.

I went to high school at <a href="http://www.elmbrook.k12.wi.us/ehs/">Brookfield East High School</a> and college 
at the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin - 
Madison</a>, obtaining a degree in Medical Science in 1993. I 
fell in love with Madison. It has a charm which is unique in the 
Midwest. Everyone who knows me has probably gotten sick of me raving 
about Wisconsin and Madison, in particular. What can I say? When 
you've been to paradise, it's hard to stop talking about it... 
After graduating, I enrolled at the <a href="http://www.medsch.wisc.edu/">
University of Wisconsin Medical School</a>, where I received my MD 
in May of 1996.

I did my internal medicine residency at the <a href="http://nemc.org/home/">New England 
Medical Center</a> in Boston, Massachusetts 
(see my <a href="/content/work">Work</a> page)
and became a full-fledged doc on June 30th, 1999. The more 
time that I've spent away from NEMC, the more 
I've learned to appreciate the lessons and training that I
acquired there. At the time, however, it seemed like hell. Luckily, I
had a bunch of <a href="/content/friends">friends</a> going through 
the same process and they made hell seem manageable.

After residency, I worked as a 'locum tenens' physician for about 6 
months in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Minnesota. I was drawn away
from clinical medicine by the dot-com gold rush, but I left without any
gold. I worked for a company called <a href="http://medicalrecords.com/">
medicalrecords.com</a>. Our goal was to provide a secure place for 
the storage of health records, while also giving users personalized 
information, tools and programs to improve their health. It was a
very exciting project and I'm sure it will live again, once someone
figures out a way to make money from it.

<p class="normal">
The big upside of my time away from medicine was that I got to
reacquaint myself with my love of programming. I've donated a lot time
to the <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS project</a> and received 
an amazing amount of education and experience in return.

<p class="normal">
My day job is as an Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at New York
Medical College (<a href="http://nymc.edu/metres/index.htm">Metropolitan Hospital</a>), splitting my time between
patient care and teaching. I moved to NYC in June of 2002 and have slowly
been getting used to being an attending physician. I feel lucky to have the opportunity to take care of underserved patients in East Harlem while teaching physicians
who hail from around the world (and often know much more than I do).
