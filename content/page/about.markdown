Welcome to my home page! (Yes, I know it's 2012, but I still call it
my home page). I'm probably the luckiest guy in the world, with a
[beautiful wife](/wedding) and 3 sweet, life-loving kids to prove it.
I am a hospitalist working at a community hospital in North Carolina.
I'm a Milwaukee Malayalee who hopes to retire in NYC someday. I am
also a (free software) programmer, writer, runner, foodie, homeowner,
reader, investor, in addition to about a hundred other things. I'm
basically a wannabee Renaissance Man. Here's an
[older page about me](/old-about).
