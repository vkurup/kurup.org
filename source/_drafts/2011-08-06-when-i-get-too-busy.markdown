I've been writing a lot lately ([750 words a day](http://750words.com)
for the last 85 days, to be precise), but most of it is for my own
purposes. I want to be a better writer and I know that writing every
day is the first step in that process. Sharing that writing with the
world is also important, but that's a lot scarier to me. I'm trying to
let go of my inhibitions knowing that my 3 readers will not judge me
harshly, but it's still difficult. Today I'm sharing something that I
wrote a while back...

----------

Work was rough today. It is so hard to walk into a census of 18
patients on Day 1 and feel like you are doing any good. Near the end
of the day, I'm just going through the motions and not really properly
diagnosing or listening to patients. That's not quite true. I always
try to listen. It is the one thing that I do well. I can listen and
hear things that other people never hear. I am pretty good at
understanding what someone is really concerned about. Sometimes I
don't want to know. Like the drug abuser who is concerned that she
isn't getting enough pain meds, but presents it as a failing of the
nurses or the doctors who have taken care of her before. I know what
she wants, but I don't want to give it to her and if she's not even
going to be honest about it, then I'm not going to go digging to try
to figure it out. But overall, I am good at listening. 

I lose other skills on days like today. I don't think as much. I don't
try to figure out why the patient with improving foot wounds and
improving peri-rectal abscesses has a rising white count. Something
else is going on, but I haven't figured it out. So I end up falling
back on the plan that the previous providers put into place, without
really taking the time to investigate what might be going on. 

I lose the skill of diligence. When I come in on day 1 and have 12
patients, I take the time to investigate and document each of their
active diagnoses and I at least pay lip service to the nonactive
ones. I make sure that I've addressed commonly overlooked items like
DVT prophylaxis, code status, smoking cessation, PQRI measures and
living situation. They are easy to overlook because they don't present
themselves as active problems in most cases (i.e. code status) or they
are handled by other services (like nursing or pharmacy), so I feel
like I can drop the ball on them and know that they will be
addressed. But when things aren't busy, I take the time to cross each
T and dot each I. I definitely don't do that when I walk into 18
patients.

It's at times like this that I realize what a failing I am as a
doctor. The doctors that I looked up to in medical school and
residency would never accept what I do now. They would never leave the
hospital just because it was getting late and they wanted to see their
family. They would stay late and sacrifice in order to make sure that
everything was done. I can honestly say that I don't think I'm putting
patients in harm's way by practicing the way I do, but I know I could
do better. I just know if I did better, I would not be able to keep
working this job. I feel burned out as it is, and more time away from
my family would just make that so much less bearable. 

On the flip side, I know that I do many good things that other
hospitalists don't do well. I keep track of how patients do after I
discharge them. When I'm feeling really energetic, I contact them, but
at a minimum, I add them to a list in eBrowser so that I can keep
track of how they do. I also relish spending time with patients and
families. It's without question my favorite part of the job. I try my
best not to let my stress level shine through when I'm with
patients. I make a point of slowing down and talking in a
conversational tone and language, even on the busiest days. I don't
answer my phone or respond to pages once I've started talking with a
patient unless it is clearly an emergency. And if I do leave, then I
apologize. I encourage patients to ask questions and contact me
whenever they have questions, though I encourage them to write their
questions down and consolidate family questions for efficiency
purposes. But if a new family member comes in after I've talked to
everyone else and they have questions, I try to come back and talk to
them. I know that this particular situation annoys the heck out of
physicians, but I can understand how it happens in the real world, so
I try to accomodate. I have a good sense of sick and not-sick, even if
I'm not the most skilled diagnostician. I also have a good sense of
what to expect in a given situation. I think those are things born of
experience and it allows me to take care of patients better. I guess
I'm saying all this to make myself feel better. To tell anyone reading
this that I'm not really a slacker. Which means I'm being defensive,
which tells me that I shouldn't have to be defensive. I should just be
doing what I'm supposed to be doing so that I don't have to make
excuses for myself. OK, fine. Let's address the diligency part. What
are the things that I should be addressing in every patient that is in
the hospital?

Here is a checklist that I started using in all my patients after
writing that little rant. It's helped me focus on the little things
and more than a couple colleagues have started to use something
similar after seeing mine.

+ PCP
+ Disposition: Home/HH/ALF/SNF/DRI, estimated LOS
+ DVT prophylaxis 
+ Smoking 
+ PQRI: CHF/MI/Pneumonia/Stroke 
+ Primary family contact: Contacted today?
+ Code status 
+ Goals of care 
+ Tubes/lines: What's installed, how do the sites look?  
+ Bowels: Last moved?  
+ Activity: Can they walk?  
+ Reviewed meds?  
+ Pending labs?
