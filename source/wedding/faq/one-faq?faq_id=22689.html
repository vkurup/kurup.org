      <b>Q:</b> <i>What is the Mehndi/Sangeet?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> It's a party on the day before the wedding. It traditionally was a time that the women would come together and sing songs, while painting their hands with Henna. We're equal opportunity party-ers now, so the men are invited. Any women wishing to get their hands painted are welcome to. Everyone will be able to enjoy the music, singing, food and drink at the beautiful Puri house.

      <b>Q:</b> <i>What is the dress code for the Mehndi/Sangeet?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> Mala and Vinod will be wearing traditional Indian dress. There is no dress code for our guests, but we're guessing most people will be business casual. We encourage anyone who wishes to wear traditional Indian clothing to do so. Contact us if you need help!

      <b>Q:</b> <i>Where is the Mall of America?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> The Mall of America is at the crossroads of I-494 and Hwy-77, just 5 minutes from the airport. Here are <a href="http://www.mallofamerica.com/plan%5Fa%5Fvisit/driving_directions.aspx">directions.</a>

      <b>Q:</b> <i>What is there to do in Minneapolis/St. Paul?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> See our <a href="../content/msp.html">Minneapolis/St.Paul Information</a> page.

      <b>Q:</b> <i>How did you meet?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> The old fashioned set up. Mala did her pediatric residency in New York with Susan LaTuga. Susan's sister, Anne Pinto, did her medicine residency in Boston with Vinod. Susan and Anne's mother suggested that we should meet. We did and Mala and I have been happy ever after.

      <b>Q:</b> <i>Where did you get your invitations made?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> In India (New Delhi). We searched online and found something that we really liked. Mala's Dad and Ethan went to India in January and searched through countless stores, but couldn't find one that was quite close enough. Finally, at the last store that they visited, they found the exact invitation that we wanted. Thanks to them for all the hard work!

      <b>Q:</b> <i>Where are you going on your honeymoon?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> We only have a few days off after the wedding. We'll be going to Napa Valley, California for a little good food, a little good wine, and a lot of spa/relaxation!

      <b>Q:</b> <i>Why not?</i>
      <p>
      <b>A:</b> Because he's a scaredy-cat. He firmly believes in being powered by his own 2 feet :-)
