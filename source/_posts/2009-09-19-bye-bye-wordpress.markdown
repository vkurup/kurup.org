This site has undergone another transformation. I've ditched [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and am now using a tool called [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It's a program that runs on my laptop and generates static files from a bunch of templates. I then upload the static files to my server. Wordpress, like any dynamic software, has security risks. Especially since it's such a popular blog app, it's always under attack. I don't have the time or interest to keep up with updates, especially since my blogging is so low-profile. It's just something I do for fun. 

Static files have none of those security risks. There are a lot of static file generators out there, but I chose Jekyll because it seemed intuitive and it's run by the [GitHub](http://github.com) folks. I've started using git and GitHub and am impressed by their power so far.

This takes me full circle to my post-geocities days when I was generating static pages using [Userland Frontier](http://frontier.userland.com/). This still doesn't feel as satisfying as that did, but maybe that's only because it was such a new thing back then. I must admit that writing posts in emacs sure does feel nice.

Anyway, the design is completely ripped off from [Mark Reid](http://mark.reid.name). My design skills suck, and his rock. Of course, I am a tweaker, so I'll probably end up ruining his beauty at some point.
