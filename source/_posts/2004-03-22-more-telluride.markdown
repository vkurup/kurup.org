Sung and Lei sent me some more pics and movies from our Telluride trip. I've posted a couple of the pics at the [end of my Telluride album](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album%5fid=14178&amp;page=3). I especially like [this movie (5.2 M)](http://kurup.org/files/Telluride.AVI). I'm the one struggling down the slope and then Boris comes flashing through at the end.
