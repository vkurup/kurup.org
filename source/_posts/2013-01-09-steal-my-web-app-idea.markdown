Now that we have 3 kids, I'm always internally comparing one to the
other. Sure that's not healthy and will probably breed resentment in
them during their teenage years, but what's a bad parent to do?

I need an app that takes 2 kids' birthdays and then shows me what day
it was when the older kid was the age that the younger kid is now.
Wow, that's a confusing sentence. In simpler terms, if I have a
3-year-old and a 1-year-old, then the app would show me the day that
the 3-year-old was 1.

Then, I want the app to take that date and go through all of my
personal files (photos, notes, twitter stream, facebook stream, etc.)
and show me what was happening in our life around that day.

In short, it would show a snapshot of what our life was like when the
older kid was the age that the younger kid is now. I'd call it
WhenIWasYourAge or something catchy like that.

Seems simple enough to build, but I don't see myself getting to it
anytime soon. Smart people say to set your ideas free and if they love
you they'll come back. (Wait, I think I'm mixing metaphors here).
