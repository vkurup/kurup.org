I recently got a letter from my niece, Devi, which broke my heart...


    Dear Vinu Mamman,  

        I visited your page and you didn't put a picture of me. I am really
    mad at you because you didn't give me a picture. Why didn't you put a
    picture of me? If you don't have a picture of me, I could send you one.
    Everybody else have a picture of them. If  you have a picture you can
    put it on your computer.
    
    Love,
    
    Devi

So, Devi, I have a very special picture from our birthday party together in
August. Here it is!
