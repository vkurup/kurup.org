Oh, in my last post, I forgot to mention one other cause we supported - [The New York Botanical Gardens](http://nybg.org). I don't really think of it as charity, since we definitely get our money's worth of enjoyment out of the park. In addition, the gardens gave their members a gift this year - the Phillips Senseo Coffee Maker. This is one of those Pod coffee makers. You stick in a coffee-pod and the machine shoots boiling water through the pod and into your coffee mug. It makes 1 cup at a time, but it takes only 30 seconds, so making coffee for a group is just a matter of lining up a bunch of cups and changing the pod each time. Cleanup is easy and the coffee is suprisingly good.

But, the pods are a little expensive - it comes to about 30-40 cents per cup. And, while the coffee is good, I sure miss my [MUD](http://www.themudtruck.com/). Well, good news. [You can make your own coffee pods!](http://www.ineedcoffee.com/04/coffeepods/). Once I find the right tools (vitamin jars?), I'm going to try this, despite this ominous warning:

>Be careful not to use too big of filter or to make sloppy folds. If you plug up your machine the pressure build up will either **spray hot water all over the place** or will engage the safety locks which prevent the lid from being re-opened.
