Has anyone tried any of the Internet phone services? [Skype](http://skype.com) looks very interesting. Nice interface, lots of platforms, [high praise from people I trust](http://pinds.com/articles/2005/01/18/skype-with-a-bluetooth-headset-frickin-rocks), and most importantly, it's FREE! Well, as long as the person you're calling also has Skype. If you want to call a *real* phone, you buy credits (which seem pretty cheap). Lemme know if any of you try it out...
