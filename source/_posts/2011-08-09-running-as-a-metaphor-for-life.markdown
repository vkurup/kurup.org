title: Running as a metaphor for life

I was thinking the other day, on a run, of course, about the many ways
that running is a metaphor for life. I've [discussed some of this
before with my cousins Dilu and
Harish](/blog/2003/10/28/the-wall-is-not-a-myth/) before.

While trail running, I have come to the realization that you never
have to worry about the fork in the road, nor the decision associated
with it. During my first trail run in the forest near our home, I was
amazed by the number of single track trailheads that I saw. I didn't
take any of them that first day, content to just take the wide dirt
path along the creek. After a few runs though, I started to take some
of the single track trails and found myself amongst even more
beautiful nature. I found more forks in the trails and I agonized a
bit about taking the right one, mainly so I wouldn't get lost. Now
that I've run in the woods dozens of times, I don't worry about the
fork in the road. I know that I can take one fork today and the other
fork tomorrow. 

Life is like that too. Every decision point seems so important. Making
the wrong decision seems like it will doom me forever. But, I've found
so far that there are very few decisions that are not
reversible. Certainly some are, but even the important ones like
career and family don't have to be set in stone. I wish I had come to
this realization earlier. Every decision seems so final at the time
that I'm making it, but when you look back it seems obvious that there
are plenty of options available, no matter which path you chose. Even
knowing that bias, it's hard to remember that when a new decision has
to be made.

Some of the single track trails have pathmarkers to help keep you on
the right trail. They are little numbered plastic circles nailed to a
tree. They are few and far between. Occasionally, you'll come to a
fork in the trail and there won't be an obvious pathmarker around, so
you have to make a decision. That can be somewhat stressful, so you
keep your eyes peeled for pathmarkers as you're running to see if you
made the right decision. At some point, you've gone so far without
seeing a marker that you're almost certain that you've gone the wrong
way. Either you keep the faith and keep going, or you turn around and
try the other fork. There is no right answer. 

Life is sometimes like that. We have signposts and decision trees that
are easy to follow in many cases. But inevitably, there will be a
point where we have to make a decision without all of the evidence or
without all of the data or without a clear idea of where we're
going. Not until you take that leap of faith will you get the signal
that you've made the right decision. And sometimes that signal won't
come for a long time. I'm not sure what the point of this is, but it
seemed very profound at the time while I was running in the woods,
about to give up, thinking that I had gone down the wrong path, when I
suddenly saw the elusive pathmarker that confirmed that I was not
lost. Trail running is like that... everything is not set in stone and
predefined. You have to develop your faith and intuition, and if that
fails, accept that maybe you'll do better next time.
