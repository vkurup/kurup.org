When we made our 2018 goals last year, Kavi, Anika and I all had some running-related goals. I don't
remember offhand exactly what each of our goals were, but I think we all wanted to run more races,
because well, races are fun! I somehow stumbled on the [Triangle Race
Series](http://www.precisionrace.com/triangle-race-series2/). It's a series of a couple dozen races
throughout the year around the Triangle, so we signed up for a few. They keep standings based on
participation and placement. You get 5 points for running a race, and more if you place in your
age/gender division. We ran about 4 or 5 of the races. I hadn't really thought about the series at
all recently since I injured my right Achilles in July and haven't run at all since then. Getting
old really is a bummer. Anyways, I checked the website today and they have posted the [final 2018
results](http://www.precisionrace.com/s/Series_Rank_Report_Race25_Cash_v9_2Races-xzxt.pdf). I got
6th place in my "not-quite-old-fogey" division! Not bad, huh? Yeah, I know... it's mostly a
participation award, but still, I'm proud. But wait! That's not even the best part. I'm even more
proud of Kavi and Anika. They are both in the 0-19 age group, so get to compete against teenagers.
Kavi got 3rd place in the male 0-19 division, and Anika got 1st place in the female 0-19 division!
