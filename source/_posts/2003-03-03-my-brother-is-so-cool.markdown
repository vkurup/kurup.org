title: My brother is so cool
categories: family

I've been meaning to put this pic up for a while. That's me in back,
with my super-cool brother and his even-cooler Harley Davidson
VRod. It was about 40 degrees F and despite sitting in back and
despite having the warm helmet, I was still freezing. I can't imagine
what Manu was feeling. Halfway through the ride, I asked him, but his
face was too frozen to talk. :-)
