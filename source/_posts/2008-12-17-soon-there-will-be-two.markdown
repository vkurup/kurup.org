Kavi has been getting bored being surrounded by adults all the time. He is very happy to announce that a sibling is on its way. We're calling it blueberry. If things go on schedule, blueberry will be born sometime in June, so we'll have 2 June babies, a couple years apart.

Pregnancy has been uneventful, unless you count those recurrent waves of nausea and vomiting that Mala's been experiencing. Hopefully that will get better as we move into the second trimester.
