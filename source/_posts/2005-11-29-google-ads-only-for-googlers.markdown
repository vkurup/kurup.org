I saw this great idea over at this place called Raganwald. [Only show ads to visitors who come in from search engines.](http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2005/11/off-topic-raganadvertising.html) I really don't want friends and family to see ads, so this effectively shields them since they will probably come here by typing kurup.org in the address bar or using a bookmark.

You're welcome :-)
