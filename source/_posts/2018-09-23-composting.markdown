Guess what, we're composting now! I told you was [going to be a
gardener](/blog/2018/09/22/starting-a-garden), so now you know I'm serious. For oh so many years,
every Friday, we'd haul the garbage and recycling out and I'd think to myself, "Wow, we'd have like no
garbage at all if we were composting." It's only taken a few years of thinking that, week in and
week out, to get me to try. Actually, that's not even true. It was still way down on my future to-do
list until I got a cheap copy of ["The Complete Idiot's Guide to
Composting"](https://amzn.to/2xyqbWb). Thank you, [BookBub](https://www.bookbub.com/welcome)! (As if
I needed any other incentive to buy and read more books). But honestly, the book was excellent in
that it made me think that yes, even I could compost. So shortly after finishing it, I headed down
to the Orange County Solid Waste Center and purchased an [Earth Machine compost
bin](https://www.earthmachine.com/contact.php) for fifty bucks, and made the kids set it up near the
screen porch. We've been throwing all our copious kitchen scraps for the past 2 weeks. So far, all
that has happened is that a bunch of fruit flies think we're awesome neighbors and seem to have
moved in for the long haul. But I'm hoping that some composting starts happening soon. It's supposed
to be easy as pie, but I'm secretly worried that I'm missing something, oh, like maybe skills or
talent. But our garbage bin sure is lighter!
