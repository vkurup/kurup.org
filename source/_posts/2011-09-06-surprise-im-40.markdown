Have you ever been in one of those dreams where everything seems
normal and then a flying car (or something equally crazy) comes out of
nowhere? I'm used to having experiences like that when I'm dreaming,
but it was quite surreal to have it during waking hours.

Mala and Kavi had gone ahead (surreptiously to plan a surprise party
for someone else!). We were to meet at the ferris wheel at the Navy
Pier. I found her and she took my hand. She started leading me through
the crowds of tourists. I could sense excitement in her demeanor, but
didn't think anything of it. She led me towards a group of people and
I caught a glimpse of someone who looked like my Dad. That's
weird... why would he be here? It's at that point that neurons started
to malfunction and I began to feel like I was in a dream. Then I saw
Mala's mom and got even more confused. Slowly the group of strangers
came into focus and revealed themselves as my friends and family from
around the country. It was, without a doubt, the best birthday present
that I have ever received, or expect to receive. Thanks to Mala for
months of planning, and for wanting to make me feel special even
though I feel this way every day when I wake up next to her. Thanks to
all my friends and family who could make it and to the ones who
couldn't. If this is the culmination of 40 years on this earth, I
can't wait for the next 40!
