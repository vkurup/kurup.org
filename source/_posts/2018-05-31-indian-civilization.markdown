I briefly mentioned finding the 2012 UCLA lecture series,
"[History of Indian Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93JMjX1XECo&list=PLy3KRgc0HE8B4neta_B8LPM0G9UWy-Cqe)",
a [couple days ago](/blog/2018/05/29/renaissance-man). I'm about halfway through
and have found it thorougly illuminating. I learned a lot about India growing
up, but never in a formal way, so it's nice to have someone as skilled as Vinay
Lal connect all the loose threads into a coherent history. One of the things
that surprises me is that aside from the fact that classes are being streamed
over the internet, there is nothing different than the lectures I skipped (I
mean religiously attended!) about 20 years ago. It's a large auditorium of
students watching a very charismatic, knowledgeable speaker pacing at the front
of the class, occasionally making mostly-legible markings on a chalkboard. Not
that there's anything wrong with that. I learned a lot back in college and I'm
enjoying these lectures immensely. It just seems strange that so little has
changed in the university clasroom (at least this one from 2012) when so much
has changed in the world at large.

Actually, I find it reassuring that little has changed, at least in some
classes. There was a time when the ability to download the audio of any
university class was absolutely new. For me, that was around 2002 or so. I
listened to CS61A (UC Berkley's intro to CS course) and a few other similar
courses back then. The limitations of internet bandwidth and storage made
anything more than audio difficult back then. But now with those barriers
crushed, I was afraid that everything would be "multimedia", and not amenable to
listening while I commute to work. So, it's reassuring to find that audio-only
dissemination of knowledge is still a thing.
