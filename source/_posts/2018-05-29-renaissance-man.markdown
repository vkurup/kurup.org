I love this
[post by Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2018/05/29/wearing-many-hats/).
As someone who has found very few things that I don't find intriguing in some
way, it is nice to know that there are others like me and that maybe there's
nothing wrong with that. I love being a doctor and I love being a programmer,
and I love honing both of those crafts.

He also links to a
[2012 New York Times article about a UCLA sophomore](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/education/edlife/renaissance-man.html)
who spends 1 hour each day learning something new, mainly by taking online
courses from other universities or watching how-to videos on YouTube. We live in
a golden age, don't we? I mean, sure, people will look back at our period of
history and cringe quite a bit, but the idea that I can search just about any
term, and find information about it on Wikipedia, and probably find a course on
it by an actual college professor.... it's just mind boggling. I'm lucky as it
is, but I often think about if I was a kid growing up in this era. I'd be
overwhelmed, sure, but I would totally be taking online courses left and right.

Actually, even if I weren't a kid. I just googled the subject of that NYT
article and found his twitter account. His
[most recent post](https://twitter.com/_TheDancingFox_/status/686341754262429696)
is from 2016 but links to a YouTube series from UCLA on the history of India. I
am TOTALLY watching that.
