In November 1998, I travelled to India to visit family and work in an
Infectious Disease Clinic.  I visited the Trivandrum Medical College and
the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institue For Medical Sciences & Technology. The
experience at the Trivandrum Medical College was a little disappointing,
but I was very impressed by the Sree Chitra Institute. I got a personal
tour of the hospital and operating rooms from Dr. Krishnamanohar (a close
friend of my brother-in-law). The standards were equal to U.S. Hospitals
and I learned a lot about physical diagnosis in a very short time.
