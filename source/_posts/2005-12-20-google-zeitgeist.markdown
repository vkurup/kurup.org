Every year, Google does an analysis of search queries over the past year. They call it the [Google Zeitgeist](http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist2005.html). It's interesting to see how 'what we search for' is a very accurate historical record of our times. The Apple iPod takes up 4 of the top 10 searches on [Froogle, Google's consumer search engine](http://www.froogle.com).

If you liked Zeitgeist, you can monitor [weekly updates](http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/zeitgeist.html).
