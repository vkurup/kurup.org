You may have noticed that I've rearranged the furniture a little. It's
been almost 2 years since I last redesigned my blog, so I'm way
overdue for a pointless redesign. I'm now using
[Octopress](http://octopress.org) which basically takes
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and adds nice HTML5
templates, cross-browser stylesheets, jekyll plugins, and a few build
scripts to automate common tasks.

Enjoy my new site and let me know if you find any issues. The [source
code for my site](https://github.com/vkurup/kurup.org), as always, is
at github. Please let me know if you have questions about it. I'm also
taking bets on how long this design lasts.
