In March '98, after a grueling month in the ICU, I went on a cruise with my
cousins and their parents. I'm currently seriously considering working as a
cruise physician! We went to Freeport and Nassau. The weather and scenery
were beautiful, but my most enjoyable moments were spent discussing old
(and new) times with my cousins at 3:00 AM looking across the unending
ocean.

It's an experience I hope to repeat soon...
