    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I built a web application to keep track of my running a couple years
ago. I really began using it in earnest during my training for the New
York Marathon last year. I've been meaning to make it available for
others to use for a long time, but it always seemed like there was a
little more work I needed to do on it. While working on it the other
day, I noticed the original timestamp on one of the source files:
<strong>September 21, 2003</strong> Yikes! That's 2 and a half years ago. Enough is
enough &mdash; it's time to let this baby free...</p>

<p><a href="http://kurup.org/run">Hit The Wall</a> is officially version 0.2 and
available for free use by anyone who wants to keep track of their
running. Feel free to look through <a href="http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=16832">my real log
(read-only)</a> or
<a href="http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=63350">demorunner's fake log
(read-write)</a> to try it
out.</p>

Cool little tool Vinod, but after reading the reference on the Wall
and how to avoid it I have some alternative names:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't Hit The Wall - A Running Log</li>
<li>Avoiding The Wall - A Runner's Log</li>
<li>Going Through Walls - Running Log</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

Good point. I just thought 'Hit The Wall' sounded catchy. And it works
in the same vein as FSF's text pager being named 'less' (rather than
'more'). Get it? :-)
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, it's better than the previous name I had in mind,
which was 'Running Log".

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It wasn't easy, but I finally got OpenFTS-0.3.2-tcl to compile on Mac OS X (10.2.8). I started by reading the excellent Mac OS X porting guides from <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/porting/basics.php">Fink</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/intro/chapter_1_section_1.html">Apple</a>. Unfortunately, the OpenFTS Makefile and configure scripts aren't standard, so I had to muck around with things alot. Here's the diff:</p>

<p>Then, follow the instructions in AOLSERVER.INSTALL. I'm not too handy with this Makefile/configure stuff, so I'd appreciate any guidance on how to do this properly :-).</p>

<p><b>Doesn't compile on Panther</b></p>
<p>
Hi Vinod,
</p>
<p>
Your fix for makefile doesn't seem to be working on Panther. Configure
script goes through but when compiling I get the following error:
</p>
<pre>
cc -o Parser.so -shared Parser.o deflex.o flexparser.o
cc: unrecognized option `-shared'
ld: Undefined symbols:
_main
_Tcl_AppendElement
_Tcl_AppendResult
_Tcl_CreateObjCommand
_Tcl_GetIntFromObj
_Tcl_GetStringFromObj
_Tcl_NewIntObj
_Tcl_NewStringObj
_Tcl_ObjSetVar2
_Tcl_PkgProvide
_Tcl_SetObjResult
make[1]: *** [Parser.so] Error 1
make: *** [parser] Error 2
</pre>
<p>
I'll keep on searching for what should be changed and will keep you
posted. Otherwise thanks for spending your time on OS X issues.

<p>
OK, from apple dev docs:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>-shared</code></dt>
<dd>In GCC 2, generates shared liibraries. In GCC 3, this
option is not supported, so you should use libtool (or use ld
directly) instead. Shared libraries in Mac OS X may be different from
those you are accustomed to on other platforms. See <a
href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/compiling/chapter_4_section_7.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001003-CH206-TPXREF103">&#8220;Dynamic
Libraries and Plug-ins&#8221;</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Don't know how to fix this in this case, though.</p>

Hey Jarkko,
</p>
<p>
I think you're trying to compile all of OpenFTS and that doesn't work
(at least I haven't tried to get it to work). I just wanted to compile
the nsfts.so module, which is all that you need for OpenACS. So,
instead of doing <code>make</code> in the Search-OpenFTS-tcl-0.3.2
directory, <code>cd aolserver</code> and do the <code>make</code>
there.
</p>
<p>
I think if you follow the directions in the AOLSERVER.INSTALL file,
it'll work.

Thanks, Vinod,
</p>
<p>
You're right. I actually thought I was running the make in aolserver
dir, but now that I retried it there, it went through smoothly :o)
