    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dailylit.com">DailyLit.com</a> is an interesting service that takes classic books and chops them up in to bite-sized pieces that you can read in just a few minutes. It then emails you one piece at a time until you finish the book. You can customize how often you get the emails.</p>

<p>I just finished "The Art of Money Getting", by P.T. Barnum. It has a lot of practical advice, and predates (by 100 years) a lot of what you see these days in self-help books. There are a lot of gems in here, but this is one of my favorite quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Strict honesty, not only lies at the foundation of all success in life (financially), but in every other respect. Uncompromising integrity of character is invaluable. It secures to its possessor a peace and joy which cannot be attained without it--which no amount of money, or houses and lands can purchase.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can't wait to figure out what I'm reading next.</p>
