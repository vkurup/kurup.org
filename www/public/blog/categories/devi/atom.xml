    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently got a letter from my niece, Devi, which broke my heart...</p>

<pre><code>Dear Vinu Mamman,  

    I visited your page and you didn't put a picture of me. I am really
mad at you because you didn't give me a picture. Why didn't you put a
picture of me? If you don't have a picture of me, I could send you one.
Everybody else have a picture of them. If  you have a picture you can
put it on your computer.

Love,

Devi

<p>So, Devi, I have a very special picture from our birthday party together in
August. Here it is!</p>
