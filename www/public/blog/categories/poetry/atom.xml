    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"Here it comes!" His eyes light up.<br/>
Slurps one last sip from his small cup.</p>

<p>Then bounding from the kitchen table,<br/>
Fast as lighting, he is able</p>

<p>To trash his scraps and stow his dishes.<br/>
He yells to Mom, "It was delicious!"</p>

<p>One more breath then on the couch he lands.<br/>
"What's up?" says Mom. Dad shrugs his hands.</p>

<p>Big brother also has no idea.<br/>
Big sister sighs, "He's a weird one I fear."</p>

<p>We gather round to be sure he's fine.<br/>
Eyes glued to his wrist, "It's 7:29!"</p>

<p>And then the beeping fills the room.<br/>
The smile confirms he's over the moon.</p>

<p>The source of this happiness, on his arm,<br/>
His brand new watch, and a 7:30 alarm.</p>

<p>(A real-life story, barely embellished)</p>
