    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to sign up for the <a href="http://donotcall.gov/">National Do-Not-Call Registry</a>, but I'm not sure that it's going to reduce the number of calls I get. Look at the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/dncalrt.htm#Exceptions">exemption list</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Exempt businesses include:
- long-distance phone companies
- airlines
- banks and credit unions; and
- the business of insurance, to the extent that it is regulated by state law.</p>

<p>However, many telemarketing calls are placed by professional telemarketing companies, and even if the company whose goods or services are being sold is exempt, the telemarketing company may be covered.</p>

<p>You may still receive calls from political organizations, charities, telephone surveyors or companies with which you have an existing business relationship.</p></blockquote>

<p>The list of telemarketers who don't fit into the exemption list seems kinda small to me...</p>

<p><b>Get tele-zapper</b></p>
<p>
Hey Vin, you want to get rid of telemarketing calls get a tele-zapper
they work great. They're like thirty bucks and easy to hook up. I used
to get around 10 -15 calls a week and now I might get one every 3
months, and what's great is that if its a telemarketer on the line its
just silent on the line like there's nobody there so you don't have to
talk to them. It then zaps your phone number out of there system.

<p>
Hey Andy!
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the note - I had never heard about the <a
href="http://www.telezapper.com/default.asp">TeleZapper</a>
before. Does it actually emit a audible tone to anyone that calls you?
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to solve my telemarketer problem by never being home to
answer the phone :-)
