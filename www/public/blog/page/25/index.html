  <div class="entry-content"><p>An article in the NY Times claims that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/science/12MAIL.html">&#8216;6 degrees of separation&#8217; is an exaggeration</a>. They tested it by asking people to forward emails to people that they knew in hopes that the chain would eventually lead to 1 of the researchers&#8217; destinations. I know that I delete any chain mail that I get, so I&#8217;m not sure that the study&#8217;s results are valid.</p>

<p>Let me provide an anecdotal rebuttal. I went to <a href="http://www.archana-subhasis.us/">Subha and Archana&#8217;s wedding</a> in Chicago last weekend and I&#8217;m guessing there were 400 people there. I met about 20 people whom I hadn&#8217;t met before. Of those, 2 had links to me through people who had nothing to do with the wedding. One was a cousin of Sushil, my good buddy from Boston. The other one is a little more convoluted. My cousin Deepu was the inspiration for the name of a musical group when he was at Wash U in St. Louis. Deepu has since moved on to San Fran, so the group has changed its name. A person I met at the wedding is currently a member of that group and has always wanted to meet the infamous Deepu, whose name is plastered over the other members&#8217; instruments.</p>

<p>Now, does being connected through a band&#8217;s name count as a degree of separation?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was pouring, monsoon-style here in NYC today, but I went running anyway. When it&#8217;s raining, no one else is out, so I get the path to myself. And jumping over (or through) the puddles makes me feel like a tough guy. I swear I can hear the Rocky theme song when I run in the rain. The only bad thing about running in the rain is that the always-stunning midtown skyline gets obscured by the clouds.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t run outside since July 13th when my knee started hurting. I&#8217;ve run on the treadmill a couple times this week and my knee felt fine, so I decided to hit the pavement today. I ran to the East River and all the way down to the South Street Seaport. About 8 miles in 90 minutes. My knee was a little sore at the end but it feels fine now.</p>

<p><b>Pains of Running</b></p>
<p>
I think my body is trying to send me a message.  Since the beginning
of this year I really began to elevate my mileage.  I started with a
5k race in the beginning of April then a 5 mile race by the end of
April and then a mini-marathon in the beginning of May.  During this
whole time period I could feel my heels and body begin to have more
aches and pains.  I took about 2 weeks off of running after all of
this and have been back into my running for the past 2 months.
Lately, I have noticed myself skipping some runs.  I find it very
frustrating.  I tell myself&#8230;.are you just being a wimp!  Today I
skipped a long run.  A 12 miler.  I woke up this morning feeling very
achey(back and heels).  I am telling myself to maybe take a couple of
days off or running and instead doing some stationary bike, which
really sucks!  I have come to realize that I need to focus more and
just finishing the Marathon I am training for than trying to kill
myself for a great time.  Vinu, I feel your pain cuz!

Hey Harish! I think you have the right attitude. Just set your goal on
the finish line and I guarantee you&#8217;ll be happy with your
performance. And I think I can say with some conviction that &#8220;You,
sir, are NOT a wimp!&#8221; It&#8217;s good to back down on your training every
once in a while - let your energy regenerate again. Don&#8217;t worry -
there&#8217;s still plenty of time left!

Keep up the strong work, Rocky&#8230;er, Vinu.  I&#8217;m in the middle of 2
continuous weeks of &#8216;nightfloat&#8217; (8p-8a shifts) which is sapping my
will to live, not to mention my ability to run.  I went for a long run
(maybe 11 miles) this past weekend, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m going to have
the heart for more than a few miles these next 1.5 weeks. Gotta keep
trying.. Really looking forward to seeing everyone again in a couple
of weeks!  Harish, hang in there.  It&#8217;s no crime to take a couple of
days to rest before getting back to the training&#8230;

Just make sure it&#8217;s the proper Rocky Theme, and not the Weird Al

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A young guy came in as a walk-in with some mild shortness of breath on exertion and associated chest pain. He was the last patient that I saw during a long, busy day and his symptoms were very mild. I was thinking that maybe he had mild asthma or a respiratory infection, but he didn&#8217;t look sick at all. Then I listened to his heart. A loud holosystolic murmur throughout with a fixed split S2. Wait, wait. I know this one&#8230;. (sounds of my mind clunking along) ASD - <a href="http://www.heartpoint.com/congasd.html">Atrial Septal Defect</a> (<a href="http://www.ucsfhealth.org/childrens/medical_services/heart_center/congenital/conditions/atrial/signs.html">Patient Information</a>).</p>

<p>He had his echocardiogram today which confirmed that he had a large ASD (We don&#8217;t need no stinking echo!). He&#8217;ll be going to Bellevue for repair and most likely will do very well. I explained everything to him (in Spanish &#8220;un agujero in su coraz&oacute;n&#8221;). It&#8217;s times like these that make me glad that I get to do what I do.</p>

Nice pick up!  Are they going to close it percutaneously (i.e. in the
cath lab?)

<p><b>Good question</b></p>
<p>
Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have a cath lab here at Metropolitan, so all
of our cards stuff goes to Bellevue, which is kinda like a black
box. Hopefully he&#8217;ll follow-up soon and with a lot of luck, he may
even come with a procedure report :-)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went whitewater rafting in Pennsylvania in 2000, sea-kayaking in North Carolina in 2001, and <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5317">death-marching (er&#8230; hiking) in the Grand Canyon in 2002</a>. This year, we chose <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5564">kayaking and hiking in Seattle</a>.</p>

<p>We went kayaking near the <a href="http://www.guidetosanjuans.com/">San Juan Islands</a> on Thursday. It was a great upper body workout and our guide <a href="http://sea-quest-kayak.com/sea-kayaking-guides.htm">Martine</a> was a fountain of information. We saw some harbor seals close up and a bald eagle from afar. We (well some of us) were really hoping to see whales, but unfortunately, they didn&#8217;t cooperate.</p>

<p>On Friday, we drove south to <a href="http://www.mount.rainier.national-park.com/">Mt. Rainier</a>. The skies were overcast in Seattle but they conveniently cleared up just as we neared the park. The views were breath-taking (or was that the hiking?). We trekked around Paradise (yup that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called) along a path that Manu picked out. It was challenging, but we wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. One of the climbs took us to the top of the cliff where Manu warned Noel, &#8220;If you fall, Anita won&#8217;t let you join us next year!&#8221; After a quick well-deserved soak in the hotel&#8217;s outdoor jacuzzi, we finished the night with some amazing sushi at Shiro. Everything was great but I could&#8217;ve done without the Uni (sea urchin) - those who didn&#8217;t eat it seemed to enjoy it the most.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, we played our annual basketball game. Because of some logistical details, I had the fortune of playing on the young-guys team in game 1 and the old-guys team in game 2. My team lost both games, thus graciously providing both the oldies and the kiddies with bragging rights. I took a few movies - <a href="http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1618.AVI">Harish making a shot</a>, <a href="http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1620.AVI">Girish with a tough shot</a>, and <a href="http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1621.AVI">Dilu with some fancy dribbling</a>.</p>

<p>After basketball, we ate brunch at the Space Needle and took in the great views of Seattle and Mt. Rainier in the background. Saturday was a day to relax and take in the city without exercising too many muscles.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m skipping over a lot of details, but the bottom line is that I had an amazing time. It&#8217;s always more fun than I imagine it could ever be. I can&#8217;t wait til next year.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://kurup.net/seattle.htm">Manu&#8217;s site</a> for some more pictures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The topic of music sharing and its legality came up during our annual cousins trip in Seattle. Here&#8217;s an important article on <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/howto-notgetsued.php">How Not to Get Sued by the RIAA</a>. The most important thing is the last line in the article:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://secure.eff.org/">Join EFF</a> and support our efforts to protect file-sharing.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t use P2P music-sharing apps anymore. While I love the idea of being able to access an unending library of music, I don&#8217;t like the idea of getting it for free. What? Sure, call me strange, but I like the idea of an artist getting a benefit for entertaining me - something that will encourage them to make even more great music. I tend to buy music at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple Music Store</a> or directly from the artists if possible (e.g. <a href="http://www.livephish.com/">Phish</a>). In both cases, the artists get much more of the proceeds than they do through other channels.</p>

<p>Now, I also copy new stuff from friends and family (Thanks Dave and Deepu!), but I don&#8217;t feel too guilty about it because they always introduce me to things I would never have heard otherwise and if I hear something I like, I&#8217;d usually go buy more of it. RIAA&#8217;s current actions (link broken), if they&#8217;re doing anything, are making me more reluctant to buy music through normal channels. Why should I support an industry that seems to care neither about the artists nor the customers. Music sharing will help artists and it certainly provides us with more variety than the RIAA and its cohorts are providing. We just need to work on ways to improve the flow of money and music between listeners and artists. The <a href="http://www.eff.org/share/compensation.php">EFF is working on this</a>.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2003-07-20T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 20<span>th</span>, 2003</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s the steps I take in order to update my site from the latest OpenACS CVS. All of this info comes from <a href="http://piskorski.com/docs/cvs-conventions.html">Andrew Piskorski&#8217;s great CVS page</a> or from pages listed in his document.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure that I&#8217;ve committed all the local changes that I&#8217;ve made.</p>

<p> vinod:~$ cd web/kurup
 vinod:~/web/kurup$ cvs commit -m &#8220;Fixed foo, bar and blah&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Go into the directory containing my OpenACS CVS checkout and grab the latest sources. I&#8217;m using the <code>oacs-4-6</code> branch.</p>

<p> vinod:~/web/kurup$ cd ~/web/openacs-4
 vinod:~/web/openacs-4$ cvs update -r oacs-4-6</p></li>
<li><p>Import the code into a vendor branch. My repository name is <code>kurup</code>. <code>OpenACS</code> is the vendor tag.</p>

<p> vinod:~/web/openacs-4$ cvs -d /var/lib/cvs \</p>

<pre><code>  import -m "importing latest OpenACS 4.6 branch" \
  kurup OpenACS openacs-4-6-3-20030719 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This produces the usual CVS scroll and then a message like this:</p>

<p> 7 conflicts created by this import. Use the following command to help the merge:
 cvs -d /var/lib/cvs checkout -j&lt;prev_rel_tag&gt; \
 jopenacs-4-6-3-20030719 kurup</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the instructions just given above. This will checkout a full set of code into the <code>kurup</code> directory, while simultaneously merging the new imported code in.</p>

<p> vinod@vkurup:~/web/openacs-4$ cd
 vinod@vkurup:~$ mkdir tmp
 vinod@vkurup:~$ cd tmp
 vinod@vkurup:~/tmp$ cvs -d /var/lib/cvs checkout \</p>

<pre><code>  -jOpenACS:yesterday \
  jopenacs-4-6-3-20030719 kurup 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Go through and fix all the conflicts. This is the part that I sometimes find confusing. How to find the files that have conflicts? The command in instruction #3 above will list conflict files with a C in front of the filename. Check each file that has a C in front of it. This is why I like to do this process inside an emacs shell, so that I can look over the output as needed. For example, one piece of my listing looked like this:</p>

<p> U kurup/packages/lars-blogger/www/blog-oracle.xql
 U kurup/packages/lars-blogger/www/blog.adp
 C kurup/packages/lars-blogger/www/blog.tcl
 U kurup/packages/lars-blogger/www/calendar-oracle.xql</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So, I need to check ~/tmp/kurup/packages/lars-blogger/www/blog.tcl, look for conflict markers and resolve any conflicts. Do this for every file marked &#8216;C&#8217; in your listing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Commit my work.</p>

<p> vinod:~/tmp$ cd kurup
 vinod:~/tmp/kurup$ cvs commit \</p>

<pre><code>  -m "merged with openacs-4-6-3-20030719, conflicts resolved" 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Blow away that tmp checkout</p>

<p> vinod:~/tmp/kurup$ cd
 vinod:~$ rm -r tmp</p></li>
<li><p>Update my local checkout</p>

<p> vinod:~$ cd web/kurup
 vinod:~/web/kurup$ cvs update</p></li>
<li><p>Restart my server.</p>

<p>vinod:~$ svc -t /service/master</p></li>
<li><p>Once the server is back up, I visit <code>http://kurup.org/acs-admin/apm</code> with my broswer and click on &#8216;Install Packages&#8217;. I look for any packages that are listed as &#8216;Upgrade&#8217;. Click on these packages and follow the instructions to perform any needed upgrades. This is always a touchy process because if the upgrade script errors out, your server may be left in an in-between state. Hope and pray liberally.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat as needed, maybe monthly, or whenever there&#8217;s a new feature/bugfix available that you need.</p></li>
</ol>

19/Jul/2003:00:00:23     Error: nscgi: wait for /home/vinod/cgi-bin/mt failed: No child processes
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to run <code>/home/vinod/cgi-bin/mt/mt.cgi</code>. Why isn&#8217;t this working? Because I need to tell AOLserver about each and every directory which might contain CGI programs.</p>

<p>So I need to change my <code>nsd.tcl</code> from:</p>

<pre><code>ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/nscgi"
ns_param   map "GET  /cgi-bin /home/${user_account}/cgi-bin/" 
ns_param   map "POST /cgi-bin /home/${user_account}/cgi-bin/" 
ns_param   Interps CGIinterps
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/nscgi"
ns_param   map "GET  /cgi-bin /home/${user_account}/cgi-bin/"
ns_param   map "POST /cgi-bin /home/${user_account}/cgi-bin/"
ns_param   map "GET  /cgi-bin/mt /home/${user_account}/cgi-bin/mt" 
ns_param   map "POST /cgi-bin/mt /home/${user_account}/cgi-bin/mt" 
ns_param   Interps CGIinterps
</code></pre>

<p>Problem solved. Further reading: <a href="http://jongriffin.com/static/consultant/nscgi">http://jongriffin.com/static/consultant/nscgi</a> -  sure wish I had read that before I started messing with ns_cgi.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How to set up WEP encryption:</p>

<ul>
<li>SMC Barricade Basestation</li>
<li>Airport Extreme Wireless Card</li>
<li>Mac OS X 10.2.6</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that if things don&#8217;t go 100% right, you may lock yourself out of your wireless network. Be sure you know how to get back in before you follow any of these instructions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up non-encrypted transmission first. Make sure you can connect to your basestation and surf on the internet.</li>
<li>Visit your basestation&#8217;s URL - default is http://198.168.123.254</li>
<li>Log in (You <strong>have</strong> changed the password so it&#8217;s not &#8216;admin&#8217;, right?)</li>
<li>Click on Wireless.</li>
<li>Create a Network ID (SSID). I&#8217;ve read that <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/stories/2002/03/20/aWeekofWireless.html">leaving it at &#8216;default&#8217; sometimes causes problems</a>, so change it.</li>
<li>Check the &#8216;Enable IEEE 128 bit Shared Key security&#8217; radio button</li>
<li>Now we need to enter a key. This should be a 26 digit Hex code. Simply go to the <a href="http://www.warewolflabs.com/portfolio/programming/wepskg/wepskg.html">magic WEP Strong Key Generator</a>. Click on &#8216;generate 128 bit key&#8217; and scroll down to see your new key. Pick the one labeled HEX. Enter this value as &#8216;WEP Key 1&#8217;. Keep this key visible somewhere, since you&#8217;ll need to feed it to your Mac so you can login.</li>
<li>Click &#8216;Save&#8217; and then &#8216;Reboot&#8217; your wireless router.</li>
<li>OK, now you&#8217;re locked out of your basestation. Let&#8217;s get back in.</li>
<li>Click on the Airport Icon in the menubar. Choose &#8216;Turn Airport Off&#8217;. Wait a few seconds and then click &#8216;Turn Airport On&#8217;.</li>
<li>Wait a few seconds for your Mac to recognize your network. Then, click on the Airport icon again and choose your Network-ID. A password box should pop up.</li>
<li>Click the drop-down menu and choose &#8216;128 bit Key&#8217; and then re-enter your 26-digit HEX key. And no, copy and paste won&#8217;t work - you need to enter it digit by digit. Check the &#8216;Keychain&#8217; box so that you don&#8217;t have to re-enter that hideous key each time.</li>
</ol>


<p>Enjoy your new encrypted network!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ugh&#8230; I woke up this morning with a nagging pain in my right knee. It kinda improved through the day, so I wasn&#8217;t too worried about it, but when I tried to run on it this evening, it really hurt. So I&#8217;m gonna keep to the bike for awhile. I remember having this problem (which I think is <a href="http://www.emedx.com/emedx/diagnosis_information/knee_disorders/patellar_tendonitis_outline.htm">patellar tendonitis</a>) during the <a href="/blog/2000/10/23/marathon">last marathon</a> and I remember that it got better pretty quick, so I&#8217;m praying it&#8217;s the same this time.</p>
