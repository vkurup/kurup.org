        <h2>About the Book</h2>

        <p>
          <i>My Daddyji: Security Chief to India's Nehru</i>, by Rajshree Puri,
          presents simultaneously an intimate inside view for the reader of
          a particular time in the historical context of a country and a
          vulnerable era in the coming of age of a young girl. In the
          layers between the public and the private, the reader also gains
          an understanding of the rich heritage of family, culture, and
          personal faith of India. Through the eyes of the narrator, we
          follow the story of volatile political events while sensing, at
          the same time, a concern for the beloved father who must keep his
          country and his family safe from ensuing turbulence. When events
          turn to tragedy and loss, we witness the resilience and strength
          of the one who has become our heroine and see rising in her those
          qualities of power and tenderness we noted in her father. She
          becomes his legacy, and her story about him ensures the enduring
          essence of his. -- Gladys S. Lewis, Ph.D.

        <h2>About the Author</h2>

        <p>
          Rajshree Puri's love of the English language parallels with that
          of her father's. She lives in her dream home in Minnesota, USA,
          where distinct seasons are constantly at display. Extreme cold
          and pleasantly warm temperatures augment glorious rainbows on
          natures beautiful theater. It is here that she lives a satisfied
          life of a wife, mother and a grandmother. After completing a
          Bachelor of Arts degree with continued Masters in English in
          Punjab, India, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science and a
          Masters of English in Creative Writing from Oklahoma, USA. <i>My
          Daddyji</i> is the first memoir written about her
          ancestors. Since nonfiction remains dear to her heart, another
          memoir is in the works for her readers.
