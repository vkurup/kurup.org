<p> I try to do my portfolio cleanup every 3 months, selling any companies that don't fit my strategy and buying new ones that do. So, I'm selling 5 stocks. I haven't decided on my buys yet, but I'm looking at BAMM, BZ, CALM, ESP, PWX, SCX and SRT (among others). </p>  <table cellspacing="0"> <tr> <th>Stock</th>  <th>Purchase Date</th>  <th>Total Return</th> <th>Reason for sell</th> </tr>  <tr class="list-odd"> <td>Ameron (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AMN">AMN</a>)</td>  <td>7/7/2004</td>  <td>11.27%</td> <td>No improvement in the financial results over the past year. I got sick of their ridiculous executive compensation. CEO took home $17 million last year, while net income for the company was only $13 million.</td> </tr>  <tr> <td>Ashworth (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ASHW">ASHW</a>)</td>  <td>7/7/2004</td>  <td>0.75%</td> <td>I probably should've sold this back in February or May when it was in the 11's. Instead I sold it about where I bought it at $8. Still undervalued, but its fundamentals aren't as promising as they were a year ago. They've taken on an acquisition which seems a little outside their circle of competence. They're a golf clothing company and they bought a hat company specializing in college sports and NASCAR. Doesn't quite fit. Share count is increasing, no free cash flow, taking on more debt, return on assets decreasing, CFO left. I claim failure on this one. </td> </tr>  <tr class="list-odd"> <td>Building Materials Holding Corp (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BMHC">BMHC</a>)</td>  <td>9/13/2004</td>  <td>246.94%</td> <td>It's hard to sell a stock that has been on such a run, but it's even harder to watch a stock tank when you knew you should have sold. Of course, I have no way of knowing if BMHC will tank, but I do know that it doesn't meet my criteria for a stock in my portfolio. I bought this last year because I noticed that it had a PE ratio < 10, a P/B ratio near 1, and it was paying a dividend. The P/B ratio is now over 3, so it's no longer such a great value. It's benefitted from the great housing market nationwide, but I don't think that can last forever. Again, BMHC may go up from here, but that's OK because I'm only interested in owning stocks that fit into my philosophy - small and cheap.</td> </tr>  <tr> <td>Flagstar Bank (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FBC">FBC</a>)</td>  <td>11/1/2004</td>  <td>-8.14%</td> <td>See my post about <a href="http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=20903">Flagstar earlier this summer</a>. On top of that, they guided for an EPS this quarter fo $0.45 to $0.60 and got $0.44. They still have no information on why the auditor quit. They're hiring 2 big-4 accounting firms to help with compliance, in addition to another auditor for their general financial statements. I also don't quite understand how to evaluate financial companies, so I'm bowing out now.</td> </tr>  <tr class="list-odd"> <td>Merck (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MRK">MRK</a>)</td>  <td>9/25/2004</td>  <td>-2.00%</td> <td>I bought this before I'd decided to focus on small caps. Merck just doesn't fit into my philosophy (small value). I think the Vioxx concerns are overblown, but I also wish Merck would've been more upfront with physicians from the beginning. I think taking Vioxx off the market was the right thing to do, even though I think Vioxx probably has some value in certain uses. Bottom line is that I'm a small cap investor, so no more Merck.</td> </tr>  </table>  <p> Here are my current holdings. </p>  <table cellspacing="0"> <tr> <th>Stock</th>  <th>Purchase Date</th>  <th>Total Return (so far)</th> </tr>  <tr> <td>Deswell Industries(<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DSWL">DSWL</a>)</td>  <td>9/20/2004</td>  <td>17.09%</td> </tr>  <tr class="list-odd"> <td>Patrick Industries (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PATK">PATK</a>)</td>  <td>2/1/2005</td>  <td>-6.48%</td> </tr>  <tr> <td>Outlook Group(<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=OUTL">OUTL</a>)</td>  <td>2/1/2005</td>  <td>33.09%</td> </tr>  <tr> <td>All American Semiconductor (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SEMI">SEMI</a>)</td>  <td>2/1/2005</td>  <td>-2.09%</td> </tr>  <tr class="list-odd"> <td>Duckwall-ALCO Stores (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DUCK">DUCK</a>)</td>  <td>2/1/2005</td>  <td>24.21%</td> </tr>  <tr> <td>Cobra Electronics (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBR">COBR</a>)</td>  <td>2/1/2005</td>  <td>15.92%</td> </tr> </table>
