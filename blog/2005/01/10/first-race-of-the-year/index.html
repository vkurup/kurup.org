<p><strong><a href='http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a50109&amp;amp;result.year=2005'>Fred Lebow Classic</a></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve run about 10 miles in the past 2 months, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting anything great on Sunday. My conservative goal was 50 minutes. I didn&#8217;t set any other goals.</p>

<p>I got to the start a little late and didn&#8217;t have time to find the baggage area, so I strapped on my backpack and ran with it. This made it feel even more like a training run, rather than a race.</p>

<p>We started on the big downhill in Central Park. Most of the <a href='http://nyrr.org'>NYRR</a> races start near there, which means you can never really take advantage of the downhill because there&#8217;s too much traffic at the start.</p>

<p>I got to the first mile marker at 11 minutes. I guess that it was really about 9:30, estimating my time to the start line at about 1:30 or so). I hit mile 2 at 20 minutes and mile 3 at 29. I had a few bursts of energy, but they faded quickly. On the whole, I just felt average. Around mile 3.5, I had a spot where I felt exhausted, almost wanted to shut it down. Every race has one of these moments. I tried to really be aware of it on Sunday, knowing that the feeling during the marathon will be 100 times stronger. Anyway, I fought through it and picked it up a bit to the finish. No sprint or anything - didn&#8217;t want to hurt myself on the first race of the year :-)</p>
