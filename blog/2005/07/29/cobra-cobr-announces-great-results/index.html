<p>Cobra Industries (<a href='http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBR'>COBR</a>) announced their second quarter results today. I bought COBR in February 2005 because they seemed really undervalued (based on Price/Book and Price/Earnings ratios). They make <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Band'>CB radios</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_way_radio'>2-way radios</a>, radar detectors, and are starting to make handheld GPS devices. Cobra owns around 60% of the CB radio market, 20% of the 2-way radio market and 60% of the radar-detector market. They&#8217;ve just started in the GPS market and their major product, the NavOne 3000, seems like a flop so far.</p>

<p>This quarter, their revenue and earning were way up and the stock price jumped 25% today (Woo hoo!). I listened to the conference call and here are my thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Revenue up 34%, especially from Radio Shack and Walmart. Demand seems good through the rest of this year.</li>

<li>Gross margin was down slightly because some retailers were experiencing high demand and were running out of product, so they had to specially ship extra inventory, at a higher freight cost. Margins should return next quarter.</li>

<li>Current GPS device (<a href='http://www.cobraelectronics.com/navone/index.php'>NavOne 3000</a>) was not well received, partly because it didn&#8217;t have a touch screen. Management says they identified this shortcoming initially but that the cost of developing a touch screen through their vendor at the time was too high. Now they realize that it&#8217;s important. Makes me wonder about their product development skills, but I&#8217;m also glad to see the honesty and the learning process.</li>

<li>New GPS device (NavOne 4500, due out this quarter) will have real-time traffic info for 45 metro areas (covering 2/3 of US population). It&#8217;s apparently the only device currently on the market to have that.</li>

<li>Accounts receivables were up compared to same time last year, but are down from end of year 2004. It&#8217;s not much out of line with increase in revenue.</li>

<li>No debt</li>

<li>Book value is now over $10 per share. Even after the run up today, the market price is still below book value.</li>

<li>Cash is up. You&#8217;d think this would be a good thing, but whenever a company starts piling up cash, they start talking about &#8230; acquisitions. Management wants to take advantage of their current distribution channels with a new product. They don&#8217;t think there is much room for internal growth. Acquisitions are troublesome, because they&#8217;re difficult to do properly and because there&#8217;s so much management incentive to do them. In addition, it&#8217;s difficult for the outside investor to see how an acquisition is really doing. I&#8217;d rather see them doing a dividend or a buyback and focusing on internal growth.</li>

<li>Share count did not increase this quarter. This is so rare to see these days. Almost every company seems to be doling out options, thus diluting current shareholders out. It&#8217;s even worse to see them doing this when their market price is so low. I&#8217;m happy to see that COBR didn&#8217;t dilute (at least this quarter)</li>

<li>SG &#38; A decreased as a percent of sales. Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs should decrease next quarter and beyond. Sarbanes-Oxley is the new post-Enron/WorldCom legislation aimed at keeping companies honest. It&#8217;s apparently quite cumbersome and expensive, especially for small public companies. Thus, the rationale for the next item&#8230;</li>

<li>Management responded to an analyst who suggested the company should be taken private by saying, &#8220;We understand your rationale, but this isn&#8217;t the appropriate place to talk about it.&#8221; (paraphrased). It sounded to me like management agrees, but I&#8217;m still a newbie at these conference calls.</li>

<li>Company stated that a buyback may be a good idea, but they want an acquisition first.</li>

<li>I liked the &#8220;feel&#8221; of the management team from the conference call.</li>
</ul>

<p>I bought COBR around 7.50, so the 25% pop puts me nicely into the green. The acquisition issue is a red flag and I&#8217;ll definitely analyze that data once it&#8217;s available, but for the moment I&#8217;m holding.</p>
