<p>Blair Corp, a company in my portfolio, announced second quarter earnings today. They were disappointing, but not as disappointing as reported by <a href='http://www.bizjournals.com'>bizjournals</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://biz.yahoo.com/bizj/060724/1320068.html'>&#8220;Blair Corp. swings to loss&#8221;</a> is the title of the article. While dramatic, it&#8217;s completely wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blair Corp., a catalog clothing retailer and direct marketer, reported a loss in the second quarter as sales fell nearly 5 percent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. They reported a profit of $233,000 in the second quarter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blair said its second-quarter results were negatively impacted by the sale of its credit portfolio and last August&#8217;s stock buyback of 4.4 million shares.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. The buyback doesn&#8217;t affect the operating results. If anything, they made the reported results look <strong>better</strong> than they really are. The stock buyback reduced the amount of outstanding shares by about one-half, so the reported earnings-per-share (EPS) results are about twice what they would have been without the buyback.</p>

<p>None of this is to deny the fact that Blair&#8217;s results were terrible and that the stock price has been even worse. I&#8217;m a little appeased by the fact that web sales increased by about 18% versus last quarter. Perhaps a few smart minds will start pursing the web angle as the wave of the future!</p>
