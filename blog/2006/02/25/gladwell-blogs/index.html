<p>Sorry for two posts about Gladwell in one day, but I just found out that <a href='http://gladwell.typepad.com/'>Gladwell has started a blog</a>. Looks like he started the day after his Columbia speech which is interesting because he put some blame on the internet for our society&#8217;s bias towards Picasso. Maybe he&#8217;s trying to test his theories :-)</p>

<p>Gladwell is one of most interesting writers I have read and is as adept a speaker as he is a writer. It&#8217;s funny though. If you were to grade his speaking based on some well accepted criteria, you&#8217;d say he was a poor speaker. He says &#8220;Ummm&#8221; and other interjections a lot. He goes off on tangents. There were times where he lost a word and he seemed stuck for a few seconds. He didn&#8217;t know the nitty gritty details of everything he talked about. At one point he was giving an example (during a tangent) and he couldn&#8217;t remember the name of the guy who Cheney shot, so he made up a name.</p>

<p>But he&#8217;s a great speaker because he tells stories very very well. He has a point that he wants passionately to get across. Finally, it&#8217;s obvious that he&#8217;s deeply thought about what he&#8217;s talking about. As a listener, you ignore the conventional shortcomings because you&#8217;re immersed in his story and you want to understand what he does. I thoroughly enjoyed his presentation and I&#8217;m subscribed to his blog.</p>
