<p>Cobra Electronics (<a href='http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBR'>COBR</a>) annouced quarterly results on Thursday. Revenue was up a little. Net income was up a lot, but mostly due to one time events. The market wasn&#8217;t impressed and the stock fell 8%. Day to day price changes don&#8217;t worry me, so that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m writing about. <a href='http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry_id=22593'>I mentioned back in July that I was concerned about the cash hoard that Cobra was amassing</a>. Specifically I said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cash is up. You&#8217;d think this would be a good thing, but whenever a company starts piling up cash, they start talking about &#8230; acquisitions. Management wants to take advantage of their current distribution channels with a new product. They don&#8217;t think there is much room for internal growth. Acquisitions are troublesome, because they&#8217;re difficult to do properly and because there&#8217;s so much management incentive to do them. In addition, it&#8217;s difficult for the outside investor to see how an acquisition is really doing. I&#8217;d rather see them doing a dividend or a buyback and focusing on internal growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that Cobra has not done any acquisitions and much to my surprise has actually instituted a dividend of 16 cents per share. Woo Hoo! Is someone on the Board reading my blog? This dividend will still leave them with a lot of cash, and they are still talking about searching for acquisitions, but the fact that they&#8217;ve sat on 6+ million in cash without doing anything yet tells me that they are being careful about finding the <strong>right</strong> acquisition.</p>
