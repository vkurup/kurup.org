<p>It&#8217;s time for my quarterly investment update. Every 3 months, I look at my portfolio and sell stocks that I don&#8217;t like and then buy ones that I do. This quarter, I&#8217;m doing <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>

<p>This is one of the hardest things for me to do. I like to trade. Sell a stock here, buy a new one here. It&#8217;s exciting. Especially when you sell a stock that&#8217;s been down for a while because then you no longer have to look at that red smirch on your portfolio every day. But while activity is a good thing in almost every other aspect of life, it can hurt you in investing. The undisputable fact is that the more you trade, the more you&#8217;ll lose on commissions and spreads. What&#8217;s more disputable, but true in my mind is that investing overactivity makes me do dumb things.</p>

<p>A couple of the stocks that I had sold over the past year have made strong runs since I sold them. AMN has gained 47% and DUCK has gained 20%. I probably shouldn&#8217;t have sold either of them, if I had followed my strict evaluation process. But I <strong>wanted</strong> to sell them. Each company had its problems, so I found good reasons to sell and justifed them to myself. The problem was that I didn&#8217;t follow the sell criteria that I had set up before I bought the stocks. I made up new ones just so I could sell the stock. If I had stuck with my initial criteria, I&#8217;d still be holding on to those two and enjoying my gains.</p>

<p>I guess my lesson is that you should decide under what conditions you would sell any stock <strong>before you buy it</strong>. Until those conditions appear, hold tight. This is especially true for small undervalued stocks because it can take a long time for the market to come around and properly value them. James Cloonan, over at <a href='http://aaii.com/'>The American Association of Individual Investors</a> runs a <a href='http://aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/'>Shadow Stock Portfolio</a> on which my portfolio is loosely based. He recommends giving small-cap value stocks at least 2 years to be recognized by the market.</p>

<p>Patience, young grasshopper!</p>
