<h1 class="emphnext">Pound update kills my website</h1>

<p>No one but me noticed, I&#8217;m sure, but my website was down for part of yesterday. Don&#8217;t worry, refunds to paying customers are on their way :-)</p>

<p>What happened? I was doing my regular debian <code>apt-get upgrade</code> and the reverse proxy that I use, <a href='http://www.apsis.ch/pound/'>pound</a>, got updated. The upgrade was a pretty significant one. Pound 2.0 changed the way that it expects configuration files to be formatted. Unfortunately, the Debian update didn&#8217;t mention this, so the new version of pound tried to read my old config file, got confused and shut down. Without a reverse proxy, there&#8217;s no way to get to my site from the outside.</p>

<p>I thought it would be simple to rewrite the config file to match the new format, but it took longer than I expected. Most of the changes were easy. The new format requires string parameters to be enclosed in double-quotes. Some of the parameters which used to be global (like ExtendedHTTP and WebDAV) were renamed and moved into non-global sections. There were a few other minor changes which make the config file easier to understand.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fixing all of that still didn&#8217;t get Pound working. There were still 2 problems. First was that the internal port number was being shown to the web browser. If you typed in &#8220;http://kurup.org&#8221;, the browser would show &#8220;http://kurup.org:8001/&#8221; in the Location bar. This only occured when the backend server returned 30x redirection status&#8217;s. Based on my config, Pound was supposed to be rewriting the Location header to avoid this problem. I found the solution to this one <a href='http://www.apsis.ch/pound/pound_list/archive/2006/2006-01/1136458627000#1136458627000'>here</a>. Scroll down to Robert Segall&#8217;s (the author of Pound) second reply. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conditions for changing the Location header are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change30x is set (value 1) for the Service in question</li>

<li>the response is one of 301, 302, 303 or 307</li>

<li>a Host header was seen in the original request</li>

<li>the Location header, after DNS resolution, points either to the same address as the one Pound is using to accept the request (aka the ListenHTTP/ListenHTTPS), or to the back-end that issued this response</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything was being fulfilled except the last one, specifically the &#8216;After DNS resolution&#8217; part. When I do a <code>nslookup kurup.org</code> on my server, it returns 66.98.222.124. The address I was using in the config file was 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Since these didn&#8217;t match, Pound was not rewriting the header. I changed my pound config to listen on 66.98.222.124 and that problem was fixed.</p>

<p>The final problem was that pound stopped redirecting requests to the other virtual servers on my machine. Whenever a request would come in, pound would crash with the following message in syslog:</p>

<pre><code>Feb 17 08:11:10 vkurup pound: MONITOR: worker exited on signal 11, restarting... </code></pre>

<p>The only difference between the config for kurup.org and the other virtual servers was that I had a SESSION parameter in kurup.org. I introduced a SESSION parameter into the other servers and <em>surprise</em>, they started working too. I finally found the reason <a href='http://www.apsis.ch/pound/pound_list/archive/2006/2006-02/1139101111000#1139101111000'>here.</a> I assume that will be fixed in the next release.</p>
