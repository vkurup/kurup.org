<p>We had a few friends over tonight for our first little get-together in our house. Mala made homemade pizza and cake. I provided moral support :-) Everyone had a great time. There were 4 little kiddos and 1 infant, which made for some craziness, but everyone left in good health. It&#8217;s a treat to watch Kavi interact with other kids. He&#8217;s a real observer. He sits back and watches what everyone is doing. While the other kids were running like crazy around the house, Kavi was content to sit on the carpet and watch them scream. He was pretty tired since he had taken an early nap, so maybe that was part of it. He also seemed happy to watch the other kids play with all of his toys. I mean, sometimes he would try to grab a toy that another kid was playing with, but for the most part, he didn&#8217;t seem to care. When we finally cleaned up and got him ready for bed, it was nearly 10 PM. He fell asleep while I was singing a lullaby to him. He woke up for a minute when I put him down, but that was it. He was tired!</p>
