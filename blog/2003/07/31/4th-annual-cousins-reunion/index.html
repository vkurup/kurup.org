<h1 class="emphnext">4th Annual Cousins Reunion</h1>

<p>We went whitewater rafting in Pennsylvania in 2000, sea-kayaking in North Carolina in 2001, and <a href='http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5317'>death-marching (er&#8230; hiking) in the Grand Canyon in 2002</a>. This year, we chose <a href='http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=5564'>kayaking and hiking in Seattle</a>.</p>

<p>We went kayaking near the <a href='http://www.guidetosanjuans.com/'>San Juan Islands</a> on Thursday. It was a great upper body workout and our guide <a href='http://sea-quest-kayak.com/sea-kayaking-guides.htm'>Martine</a> was a fountain of information. We saw some harbor seals close up and a bald eagle from afar. We (well some of us) were really hoping to see whales, but unfortunately, they didn&#8217;t cooperate.</p>

<p>On Friday, we drove south to <a href='http://www.mount.rainier.national-park.com/'>Mt. Rainier</a>. The skies were overcast in Seattle but they conveniently cleared up just as we neared the park. The views were breath-taking (or was that the hiking?). We trekked around Paradise (yup that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called) along a path that Manu picked out. It was challenging, but we wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. One of the climbs took us to the top of the cliff where Manu warned Noel, &#8220;If you fall, Anita won&#8217;t let you join us next year!&#8221; After a quick well-deserved soak in the hotel&#8217;s outdoor jacuzzi, we finished the night with some amazing sushi at Shiro. Everything was great but I could&#8217;ve done without the Uni (sea urchin) - those who didn&#8217;t eat it seemed to enjoy it the most.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, we played our annual basketball game. Because of some logistical details, I had the fortune of playing on the young-guys team in game 1 and the old-guys team in game 2. My team lost both games, thus graciously providing both the oldies and the kiddies with bragging rights. I took a few movies - <a href='http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1618.AVI'>Harish making a shot</a>, <a href='http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1620.AVI'>Girish with a tough shot</a>, and <a href='http://kurup.org/files/MVI_1621.AVI'>Dilu with some fancy dribbling</a>.</p>

<p>After basketball, we ate brunch at the Space Needle and took in the great views of Seattle and Mt. Rainier in the background. Saturday was a day to relax and take in the city without exercising too many muscles.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m skipping over a lot of details, but the bottom line is that I had an amazing time. It&#8217;s always more fun than I imagine it could ever be. I can&#8217;t wait til next year.</p>

<p>See <a href='http://kurup.net/seattle.htm'>Manu&#8217;s site</a> for some more pictures.</p>
