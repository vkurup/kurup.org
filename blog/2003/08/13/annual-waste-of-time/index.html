<p> Another interesting article in the Times today. Lo and behold, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/health/12PHYS.html">annual physical exam</a> is useless. Shocking, huh? Well, no - not really. The first <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=7030166&amp;dopt=Citation">questions about the annual physical</a> cropped up 20 years ago and recent studies have only confirmed these initial doubts. </p>  <p> So, do I perform annual physicals? Yup. Why? A few reasons.... As a relatively young doc, I think it's important to examine <b>LOTS and LOTS</b> of normal patients in order to get a firm sense of what's normal and what's abnormal. And even if I were 100% confident in my physical exam, I would still want to keep those exam skills sharp. </p>  <p> The annual physical is also a great time, if not the only time, to discuss preventive care with patients. Acute care visits are already rushed and sick patients aren't the most receptive listeners.  </p>  <p> Patients in my community are underserved as it stands - getting rid of annual physicals would only contribute to patients getting lost in the system. </p>  <p> Finally, and most importantly, performing annual physicals makes me look like a doctor. Patients expect annual physicals and I'd look like a quack if I didn't perform them, regardless of how much science is backing me up. This is one of those classic "Art of Medicine/Science of Medicine" intersections. In order to be able to practice the Science of Medicine effectively, we need to compromise on the scientific purity a bit, for the sake of the Art of Medicine. </p>  <blockquote> <p> "I still listen to everyone's heart," said Dr. Stewart Rogers, an internist at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. "Why pick that fight? Why try to explain 10 years of evidence-based medicine so the patient will understand why I didn't do that test? The reason to listen to hearts is that it establishes our priestly majesty when you tell them about smoke alarms." </p> </blockquote>  <p> That being said, I do try to explain to patients that not all tests are necessary and can in fact be harmful, but I'm not dogmatic about it. </p>
