<h1 class="emphnext">annual waste of time?</h1>

<p>Another interesting article in the Times today. Lo and behold, the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/health/12PHYS.html'>annual physical exam</a> is useless. Shocking, huh? Well, no - not really. The first <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;list_uids=7030166&amp;amp;dopt=Citation'>questions about the annual physical</a> cropped up 20 years ago and recent studies have only confirmed these initial doubts.</p>

<p>So, do I perform annual physicals? Yup. Why? A few reasons&#8230;. As a relatively young doc, I think it&#8217;s important to examine <strong>LOTS and LOTS</strong> of normal patients in order to get a firm sense of what&#8217;s normal and what&#8217;s abnormal. And even if I were 100% confident in my physical exam, I would still want to keep those exam skills sharp.</p>

<p>The annual physical is also a great time, if not the only time, to discuss preventive care with patients. Acute care visits are already rushed and sick patients aren&#8217;t the most receptive listeners.</p>

<p>Patients in my community are underserved as it stands - getting rid of annual physicals would only contribute to patients getting lost in the system.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, performing annual physicals makes me look like a doctor. Patients expect annual physicals and I&#8217;d look like a quack if I didn&#8217;t perform them, regardless of how much science is backing me up. This is one of those classic &#8220;Art of Medicine/Science of Medicine&#8221; intersections. In order to be able to practice the Science of Medicine effectively, we need to compromise on the scientific purity a bit, for the sake of the Art of Medicine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I still listen to everyone&#8217;s heart,&#8221; said Dr. Stewart Rogers, an internist at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. &#8220;Why pick that fight? Why try to explain 10 years of evidence-based medicine so the patient will understand why I didn&#8217;t do that test? The reason to listen to hearts is that it establishes our priestly majesty when you tell them about smoke alarms.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, I do try to explain to patients that not all tests are necessary and can in fact be harmful, but I&#8217;m not dogmatic about it.</p>
