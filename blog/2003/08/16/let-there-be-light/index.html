<p>The power finally came back on at around 7:20 PM tonight. I was sitting on my futon trying as hard as I could not to sweat, when I heard a loud cheer from the courtyard and saw that the lights had gone on in the apartments outside my window.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a weird couple days. The power went out around 4:15 PM yesterday while I was looking up some labs in the preceptor&#8217;s room. The A/C had been on full-blast, so we all thought that it was just an overloaded circuit, but soon we got word that nearby buildings were affected and everyone went smoothly into disaster-mode. Take care of any urgent patient needs and encourage everyone else to go home. No staff leaves until we know what&#8217;s going on. Around 6:30, we got the word that whoever was within walking distance could go home, provided that they be back first thing in the morning. I figured 4 miles is walking-distance, so I left. From the 80&#8217;s to around 63rd St, 2nd Avenue was packed with cars trying in vain to get to the Queensboro bridge. Traffic lights were off, but it didn&#8217;t seem to matter since the cars weren&#8217;t moving anyway. Civilians were trying to direct traffic with varying success. The cars obeyed, but pedestrians were on their own schedule. From the Queensboro down to the 40&#8217;s, pedestrians replaced the cars and swarmed over the street.</p>

<p>I got to my neighborhood around 8ish. Most of the local shops were out of flashlights and running low on water. I swear the people at the counter were just making up prices as they went along, but no one really seemed to care. After getting settled at home, I went for a short walk outside around 10PM. I was shocked at how dark New York was without any lights. You could clearly see the stars in the sky. It was dangerous to walk around without a flashlight because there would be people just sitting on the sidewalk waiting to be tripped over.</p>

<p>But everything is back to normal now and the only casualty is my <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime'>uptime</a></p>
