<h1 class="emphnext">The Wall is not a myth</h1>

<p>I ran the <a href='http://marinemarathon.com'>Marine Corps Marathon</a> yesterday and can now confirm that <a href='http://www.badwaterultra.com/training/bane.html'>Hitting the Wall</a> is a real phenomenon. I finished about 5 minutes faster than I did in Chicago (2000), but I was really hoping to break 4:30. Everything was going great through the halfway point (2:11:48 - 10:04 mpm) when a few doubts started to creep into my head. I&#8217;m only halfway? I gotta do this again? Somehow I was able to make it through to mile 17 at 2:55:30 (10:19 mpm) before things really fell apart. I remember it clearly yesterday and it seemed to be an instant replay from Chicago. I started thinking about how much further I had to go and how tired I already was. Then I think, well, maybe I need to rest up so I can finish strong, huh? Maybe I should walk through the next water break - that won&#8217;t be such a bad thing, right? And then the next thing I know, I&#8217;m walking more than I&#8217;m running. Once I start walking, I&#8217;m done. The key is not to think about how much further you have to go, but rather to take it one step at a time, but that&#8217;s obviously easier said than done. The marathon is not a rational thing - if you think about it and you let your rational mind make decisions for you, you&#8217;ll never accomplish your goal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still quite happy with finishing. I&#8217;m sore all over, but in that satisfying kinda way. I was able to take the train home yesterday and even made it to work today. And unlike 2000, I&#8217;m motivated to keep running, although I&#8217;m going to stay away from marathoning for a while. My left brain isn&#8217;t ready for it.</p>
