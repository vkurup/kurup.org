[Milla correctly points out](http://kurup.org/blog/2006/07/25/recurrent-dvt#comment68115) that she is my blogging inspiration.  Not just for telling me to blog more, but for providing the inspiration in the form of the [most promising blog-start ever](http://millatonkonogy.blogspot.com/)!  My [favorite so far](http://millatonkonogy.blogspot.com/2006/07/blame-it-on-rain.html):  

> I turned on 1010 Wins "you give us 20 minutes, we'll give you traffic updates from yesterday for roads you don't drive on" and heard nothing at all about the mudslide on the Saw Mill River Parkway, which turned my road home into a parking lot. 

Someone put her on a reality show, already!
