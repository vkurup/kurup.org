[Tim Bray posted the links that his browser
displays](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/03/03/ABC) when
he types each letter of the alphabet. Here's mine:

[\[A\]dSense](http://adsense.com). I spend too much time watching the
zero's pile up.

[\[B\]orkware](http://borkware.com). Always good for a
[quickie](http://borkware.com/quickies/). Wait... that didn't sound right.

[\[C\]ite-U-Like](http://citeulike.com). I've started to use this site
to keep track of journal articles that I read.

[\[D\]ocs (Google)](http://docs.google.com). I store my Habits
spreadsheet, my weight spreadsheet, our address book spreadsheet
(because Google contacts aren't shareable) and other random documents.

[\[E\]vernote](http://evernote.com). I've been trying to use this more
to keep a central repository of notes, but it hasn't stuck yet.

[\[F\]acebook](http://facebook.com). I don't know why this is there. I
never use facebook.

[\[G\]queues](http://gqueues.com). I'm surprised that Google lost this
one. I'm using Gqueues to keep track of my todos. It's pretty nice. My
main complaint is that it's a little slow and there's no Android client.

[\[H\]ttp://facebook.com](http://facebook.com). Oh, how
embarrassing. OK, my name is Vinod Kurup and I'm a facebook addict.

[\[I\]nstapaper](http://instapaper.com). I store longer articles here
for later reading. I use the [Instafetch](http://market.android.com/search?q=instafetch) client on Android to read them.

[\[J\]ournal Watch](http://jwatch.org). Phew! At least one site relevant
to my day job!

[\[K\]urup.org](http://kurup.org). The most amazing site on the internet.

[\[L\]loogg](http://lloogg.com). `tail -f access.log` for the web

[\[M\]yfitnesspal](http://myfitnesspal.com). We're using this to track
our diet and exercise. We used to use [Fitday](fitday.com), but this
is so much easier and there's a social component that is
motivating. It's amazing how comprehensive their food database is.

[\[N\]ewegg.com](http://newegg.com). Mostly for printer cartridges, but
occasionally for toys.

[Duke \[O\]utlook](http://owa.dm.duke.edu). My new work webmail. Outlook
2010 == HIT's idea of modern.

[\[P\]icasaweb](http://picasaweb.google.com). Pictures of the cutest
kids in the world.

\[Q\]. This space for rent.

[\[R\]uby-doc.org](http://ruby-doc.org). I'm trying to learn ruby (the
right way)

[\[S\]ports.yahoo.com](http://sports.yahoo.com). My University of
Wisconsin, Green Bay Packer and Milwaukee Bucks/Brewers addiction is
slow to die.

[\[T\]witter](http://twitter.com). Yup, I still use twitter.com.

\[U\]. b**U**eller... b**U**eller...

[\[V\]ictory Village](http://victoryvillage.org). Kid's daycare. Lots
of snow this winter meant lots of checks to see if daycare was open.

[Old Duke \[W\]ebmail](http://webmail.duhs.duke.edu/owa). Lotus Notes,
then Outlook 2007, now defunct.

[\[X\]KCD](http://http://xkcd.com/). The best comic strip in the world.

[\[Y\]outube](http://youtube.com). Videos of the cutest kids in the
world. Plus I think there are some other videos there...

\[Z\]. This space left intentionally blank.

And had to add (because it's so heavily used):

[\[1\]27.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000). My local [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) server.
