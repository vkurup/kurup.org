I upgraded to OpenACS 5 thanks to [instructions from DaveB, et. al.](http://openacs.org/projects/openacs/5.0/upgrade-463-50) I had a [few hitches with that process](http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=145889), but the system seems to be working OK and is certainly zippier. I haven't tested everything out yet, so please holler if anything breaks.
