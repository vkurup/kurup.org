I ran 5 more races this summer in my quest to automatically qualify for next year's [New York Marathon](http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/). The Fifth Avenue Mile was a breakthrough run for me. I easily outdid my pre-race goal of breaking 7 minutes and came within 40 seconds of my best time ever (5:07 fifteen years ago). This makes me think that I might be able to break 4 hours in the marathon next year if I train properly.
