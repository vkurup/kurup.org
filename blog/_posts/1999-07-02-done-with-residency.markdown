Well, I've finally finished my internal medicine residency at New England Medical Center. WooHoo! I guess it's time to be a real doctor now... I'm planning to spend the next year as a locum tenens physician. I'll be travelling throughout the country, working for 1-2 months at a time. Hopefully, I will get a broad exposure to different types of primary care medicine, so that I can make an informed decision down the road. I'm still considering doing a medical informatics fellowship - maybe next year... 

I've signed up with two agencies - CompHealth and VISTA.
