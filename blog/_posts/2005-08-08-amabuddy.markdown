This seems useful.

> You are in a bookshop or a record shop. You find something that interests you. You can't decide whether to buy it now or online later. What you need is a price check and a quick review, perhaps some ideas of something similar that others might recommend. [Amabuddy](http://www.amabuddy.com) can help!

What you do is call (617) 712-3574 (There's a 888 number as well, but you'll be using a cell phone anyway). Then just punch in the ISBN# and listen to the Amazon price and reviews on the book you're looking at.
