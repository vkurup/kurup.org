It was pouring, monsoon-style here in NYC today, but I went running anyway. When it's raining, no one else is out, so I get the path to myself. And jumping over (or through) the puddles makes me feel like a tough guy. I swear I can hear the Rocky theme song when I run in the rain. The only bad thing about running in the rain is that the always-stunning midtown skyline gets obscured by the clouds.

I haven't run outside since July 13th when my knee started hurting. I've run on the treadmill a couple times this week and my knee felt fine, so I decided to hit the pavement today. I ran to the East River and all the way down to the South Street Seaport. About 8 miles in 90 minutes. My knee was a little sore at the end but it feels fine now.
