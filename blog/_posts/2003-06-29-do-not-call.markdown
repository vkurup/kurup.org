I'm going to sign up for the [National Do-Not-Call Registry](http://donotcall.gov/), but I'm not sure that it's going to reduce the number of calls I get. Look at the [exemption list](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/dncalrt.htm#Exceptions):  

> Exempt businesses include: 
> - long-distance phone companies
> - airlines
> - banks and credit unions; and
> - the business of insurance, to the extent that it is regulated by state law.
>
>However, many telemarketing calls are placed by professional telemarketing companies, and even if the company whose goods or services are being sold is exempt, the telemarketing company may be covered.
>
>You may still receive calls from political organizations, charities, telephone surveyors or companies with which you have an existing business relationship.

The list of telemarketers who don't fit into the exemption list seems kinda small to me...
