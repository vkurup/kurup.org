I've been getting weird emails over the past day or so. The `From:` address is always different, there is no body text and there is an attachment called `your_document.pif`. The `From:` address is sometimes recognizable, but seems to be spoofed.

[Google only gave me 1 document for "your_document.pif"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=your_document.pif) and that document states that [this is a new virus called W32/Sobig.F-mm](http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/sobig_f.shtml) (link changed due to 404). Not much info about it yet, but it seems pretty widespread.

**Update:** Wow, google only had 1 document for the above search when I wrote this a few hours ago and now it has 391! Looks like this virus is just taking off. [Fastest. Virus. Ever.](http://www.local6.com/news/2420899/detail.html)
