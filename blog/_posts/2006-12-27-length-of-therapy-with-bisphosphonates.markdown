Sorry for another post linking to [Journal Watch](http://jwatch.org), but they really are doing a great job of reading my mind...

In my [talk to the residents about osteoporosis](http://kurup.org/blog/2006/12/24/osteoporosis-talk), I mentioned that one of the unanswered questions is how long to treat patients with bisphosphonates. Well, a [randomized trial published in JAMA](http://firstwatch.jwatch.org/cgi/content/short/2006/1227/1) says "5 years". Bone density in placebo-users decreased minimally and hip fracture risk stayed the same. Vertebral fracture risk increased, but vertebral fractures are much less significant than hip fractures. I'm sure more studies will be done, but it's reassuring to think that bisphosphonates may not be needed lifelong.
