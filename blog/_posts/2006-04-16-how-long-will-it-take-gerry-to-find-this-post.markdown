So, I just talked with one of my best friends and learned that he **still** doesn't read my blog. Devastating! We had an interesting conversation about how the value of 'The Great Idea' can be overrated and I wanted to point him to this [great essay about the same topic by Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html). Let's see how long it takes him to find it.

I enjoy most of [Paul Graham's writings](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html). He writes about startups and software, aimed at the high school/college age geek. His writings would have been invaluable when I was in high school. Of course, he was probably in high school at the time. :-)
