Dilu and Amit raced 26.2 miles in the [Chicago Marathon](http://chicagomarathon.com) today and both finished with amazing times. Dilu completed his first marathon in 4:19:18 which is less than 10 minute miles and almost an hour better than my first one. Amit ran the 2000 Chicago Marathon with me and finished in 4:30ish, I think. He ran today in 3:57:32 - breaking that elusive 4 hr barrier. Nice job guys!

Now I'm excited for the [Marine Corps Marathon](http://marinemarathon.com) - 2 weeks to go. I'll never be able to match Amit and Dilu, but I'm going to try to beat my Chicago time of 5:13:30.
