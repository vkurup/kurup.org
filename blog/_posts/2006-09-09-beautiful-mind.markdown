[This is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.](http://youtube.com/watch?v=0TibQ_1zH3U) An autistic man takes a 45 minute helicopter ride over Rome and recreates what he sees with near perfect accuracy on paper. [More information about him](http://xenmate.blogspot.com/2006/05/human-camera.html)

This guy's brain is structurally the same as mine, yet its capabilities make my brain seem like it's broken. It's not unreasonable to think that my brain could have the same capability if it were exposed to the proper conditions. I have no idea what those conditions are, or else I'd be able to cure autism. But seeing feats like this show me that there is so much that we don't know about our brains and their function. And that's kinda exciting.
