title: First full phone conversation with Kavi
tags: family parenting

I had my first full phone conversation with Kavi today. I was about to
leave work, so I called home to let Mala know that I was on my way
home. (For the second time... I got called back to help in the ER on
my first attempt, but that's another story). When the phone rang, Kavi
picked up the phone. "Hi Daddy, when are you coming home?" I told him
that I was leaving now and that I'd be home in half an hour. "OK
Daddy. Bye!" *Click* 

Hopefully, he gave the message to Mala :-)
