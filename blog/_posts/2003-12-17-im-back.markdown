This site was down for the past few days due to a [SNAFU with acornhosting's upstream provider](http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=152527). You'd think I'd have learned to have a backup strategy in place by now, but you'd be overestimating my intelligence. Luckily, Cathy was somehow able to negotiate with her failed upstream provider to get my (and other acornhosting customers') data back. After this episode, I promise to backup religiously and I'm even more sold on [acornhosting](http://acornhosting.net) as a solid web hosting provider.

Cathy indeed went the extra 25 miles for me, recovering most of my
junk.  I've started setting up backups with rsync, and it's looking
like it'll work pretty well.  Short commands on my home Mac like:
</p>

<pre>
rsync -a -e ssh markd@borkware.com:/home/markd/ home
rsync -a -e ssh markd@borkware.com:/usr/local/cvsroot cvs
</pre>

<p>
is all that's necessary to update the backup of my home and cvs
respository.  Now to get the pg_dumpall and this thing into cron on
the appropriate machine, and life should be good.
