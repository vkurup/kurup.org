I'd like to become a better writer. In order to become a better writer, you simply have to write more. Funny how most things are like that. Still, sometimes you want a little more structure. MIT has a [nice guide to writing](http://web.mit.edu/writing/Resources/Writers/process.html) that is both simple and useful. Start out by making your document <strong>writer-centric</strong>. Just get the words down on paper. Satisfy only yourself. Then, revise your writing to make it <strong>reader-centric</strong>. Add evidence, details, and explanations that your audience would need. I think this is a useful distinction because I often get bogged down thinking about what others might think when I should just be writing.
