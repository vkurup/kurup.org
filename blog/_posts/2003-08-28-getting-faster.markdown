title: Getting faster...

I got home as it was getting dark, so I ran at the gym, on the
treadmill. I usually hate running indoors, but running on the
treadmill has one huge positive point. You don't have to pay attention
where you're going. I got myself into a groove and before I knew it, I
was done with my 5 miles in about 47 minutes. Much faster than I was
just a few months ago!
