**[Fred Lebow Classic](http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a50109&amp;result.year=2005)**

I've run about 10 miles in the past 2 months, so I wasn't expecting anything great on Sunday. My conservative goal was 50 minutes. I didn't set any other goals.

I got to the start a little late and didn't have time to find the baggage area, so I strapped on my backpack and ran with it. This made it feel even more like a training run, rather than a race.

We started on the big downhill in Central Park. Most of the [NYRR](http://nyrr.org) races start near there, which means you can never really take advantage of the downhill because there's too much traffic at the start.

I got to the first mile marker at 11 minutes. I guess that it was really about 9:30, estimating my time to the start line at about 1:30 or so). I hit mile 2 at 20 minutes and mile 3 at 29. I had a few bursts of energy, but they faded quickly. On the whole, I just felt average. Around mile 3.5, I had a spot where I felt exhausted, almost wanted to shut it down. Every race has one of these moments. I tried to really be aware of it on Sunday, knowing that the feeling during the marathon will be 100 times stronger. Anyway, I fought through it and picked it up a bit to the finish. No sprint or anything - didn't want to hurt myself on the first race of the year :-)
