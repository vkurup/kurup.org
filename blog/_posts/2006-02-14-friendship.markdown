Happy Valentine's Day! Writing about love is a little risque for me, so here instead is a wonderful quote about friendship. I heard it on the [University Channel Podcast](http://uc.princeton.edu/main/) where [Robert Seiple](http://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=295&amp;Itemid=8) mistakenly attributed it to George Eliot. It was [actually written](http://www.geonius.com/eliot/quotes.html) by [Dinah Craik](http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/victorian/authors/craik/craikov.html) in her novel [A life for a life](http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/etexts/E000329.htm#X16) (1859).

> Oh, the comfort --
> The inexpressible comfort of feeling
> safe with a person,
> Having neither to weigh thoughts,
> Nor measure words -- but pouring them
> All right out -- just as they are --
> Chaff and grain together --
> Certain that a faithful hand will
> Take and sift them --
> Keep what is worth keeping --
> and with the breath of kindness
> Blow the rest away.
