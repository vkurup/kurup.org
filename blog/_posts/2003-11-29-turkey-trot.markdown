I ran two more races this past week - the [Race to Deliver 4 mile](http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a31123&amp;result.year=2003) in Central Park on Sunday and the [Turkey Trot 5 mile](http://pptc.org/gallery/2003_pptc_turkey_trot/2003_turkey_trot_gallery_01.php) in [Prospect Park](http://www.prospectpark.org/index.cfm) yesterday. The Race to Deliver was crowded with 6000 or so other runners and I spent most of the first half of the race just swerving around everyone else. I never quite got into a groove, but I was still able to finish in 32:34.

The Turkey Trot was much more fun. The first half mile was crowded, but the rest of the race was smooth sailing. I'd never been to Prospect Park before and I was pleasantly surprised by its beauty. New York City is certainly blessed with great public parks. Anyway, I ran the last 2 miles in 15 minutes to finish in 40:12. I hope to break the 8 minute barrier soon...
