I ran the [Bronx Half-Marathon](http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a50710&amp;result.year=2005) on Sunday in 2:07:05. I ran the same race last year in 2:07:02. How's that for consistent?. Of course, I'd rather be consistently _fast_ than consistently _slow_, but I'm trying to look on the bright side. By the way, I really do enjoy these races more than my pictures would suggest :-)

We started near Lehman College and ran along beautiful tree-lined streets like Sedgwick Avenue and Mosholu Parkway. The course does a few U-turns, so you get to see the leaders coming back. That's always motivating for me. The only annoying stretch is the out and back down the middle of the sun-exposed Grand Concourse. On a bright sunny day, that really drains you.

I hadn't been running consistenly, so I didn't think i'd be setting any records. I'm happy with 2:07. I just need to get in gear and be more consistent with my weekly mileage. I'm following the [NYRR Marathon - Casual Marathoner guide](http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/training/trainingschedule.php). This week I'm supposed to run 24 miles. I've got 15 down so far with a [5 mile race (Dash &amp; Splash)](http://www.nyrr.org/race/2005/r0716x00.php) planned on Saturday.
