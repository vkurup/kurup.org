> The sudden release of water from Ralston Reservoir south of Auburn sent a "wall of water three to four-feet high" down the Middle Fork of the American River, said California Highway Patrol spokesman Tom Marshall. 

That's the river that we rafted down a couple weeks ago during our [5th Annual Cousins Trip](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=14824). If it had happened during our trip, I still probably would've been the first one to fall in.
