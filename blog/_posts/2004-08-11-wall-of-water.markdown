> The sudden release of water from Ralston Reservoir south of Auburn sent a "wall of water three to four-feet high" down the Middle Fork of the American River, said California Highway Patrol spokesman Tom Marshall. 

That's the river that we rafted down a couple weeks ago during our [5th Annual Cousins Trip](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=14824). If it had happened during our trip, I still probably would've been the first one to fall in.

<p><b>Oregon's walls of water</b></p>
<p>
Oregon has its share of huge walls of water. One was <a href="http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/Portland/history.html">40 feet high</a>, in 1903, and there is a prehistorical record of a <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/columbia/missoula.htm">2000 foot wall of water</a> that carved out much of the geological formations now present in the Northwest!

Not trying to outdo you, just thought that was a pretty interesting
tidbit.

Cool! Don't worry about outdoing me. I'm sure that someday the rapids that we ran will be about 2000 feet high in my stories to my grandkids :-)
