The Daily News has found 100 restaurants under $10 (not including tip or drinks) in NYC. I've been to 9 of them - El Paso Taqueria, Carl's (aweome cheesesteaks!), Blue 9, The Burger Joint, Sassy's Sliders, Crif Dogs, Papaya King (of course), Mandler's and Pomme Frites.

Looks like we have some eating to do!
