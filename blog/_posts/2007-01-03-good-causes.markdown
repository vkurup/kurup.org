I [posted about this last year](http://kurup.org/blog/2005/12/30/good-causes), so here's our updated donation list for 2006. Again, I think they're all great causes, so I encourage you to check them out.

- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/about/) - The internet is the most innovative force in our lives and the EFF working to preserve freedom on the net.
- [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) - When [software is free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), it means that we don't have to reinvent the wheel over and over again. That allows developers to focus on more and more interesting problems.

- [Grameen Foundation](http://www.gfusa.org/about_us/microfinance/) - In the news recently because they were awarded the [Nobel Peace Prize](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/index.html), they help the world's poorest escape poverty through self-sufficiency
- [WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/) - To support my NPR Podcast habit.

You can look up most charities on the [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.fourstar.htm) website to see how efficient and organized they are. The ones above received the highest rating, 4 stars.
