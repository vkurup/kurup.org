Linux Journal featured an [article about a web application written in OpenACS](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8986). It's called [Fungoes](http://fungoes.mek.cc/) and it tabulates and formats baseball statistics. If I had access to this app when I was a kid, I would've been in heaven. I remember spending hours and hours memorizing stats from the back of baseball cards. I've forgotten most of what I memorized, but I can still rattle off HR stats for most of the 1982 Brewers. This site really takes me back.

Fungoes is still in it's early stages, but Mat apparently has big plans for it. It should be fun to watch.
