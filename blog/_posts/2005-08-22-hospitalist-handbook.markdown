If you're looking for a clear, concise handbook for Hospitalist Medicine, check out the [UCSF Hospitalist Handbook](http://medicine.ucsf.edu/education/resed/handbook/index.html), available free online. I'm not sure it's up-to-date (the copyright notice states 2002), but it still seems relevant and useful. And I'm not just saying that because my cousin Deepu Nair wrote the [Night Calls](http://medicine.ucsf.edu/education/resed/handbook/HospH2002_C1.htm) section.
