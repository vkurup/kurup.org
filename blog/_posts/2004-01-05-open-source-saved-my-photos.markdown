Loyal readers of my blog will remember that my Powerbook Wallstreet G3 died on September 21st, 2002. Since I'm probably the only one that remembers, I'll point you to that [blog entry](http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=622). The good news was that the hard drive was intact, the bad news was that I didn't have an easy way of accessing it. I have a Firewire enclosure, and my old Powerbook was running Linux, so I figured it wouldn't be too difficult to get my new Powerbook to read the data off the old HD. I mean Mac OS X and Linux are the same underneath, right? Well, not quite. Mac OS X uses a filesystem called HFS+ and my version of Linux uses a filesystem called ext2. Turns out that no one had written an ext2 driver for Mac OS X.

So, I turned to Google and with more effort than usual, found the [Mac OS X Ext2 Filesystem](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsx/) Project, or ext2fsx. I subscribed to the RSS feed and just waited until I saw the 1.0.1 product released on 11/20/2003 (Never trust the 1.0!). I loaded it up and voila! My old Wallstreet was back. Thank you [Brian Bergstrand](http://www.classicalguitar.net/brian/)!

In celebration, I've uploaded [pictures from 2001 and early 2002](http://kurup.org/photo/index?folder_id=9672) that I thought I had lost forever. Enjoy.
