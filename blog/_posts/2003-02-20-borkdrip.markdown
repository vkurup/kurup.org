Got Mac OS X? Want a cool screensaver? I stole this from [MarkD](http://badgertronics.com/blog) over at [BorkWare](http://borkware.com/products/borkware-drip/) and then modified it to allow multiple drips and configurable block sizes.

- Get the [ScreenSaver](http://kurup.org/files/Borkware_Drip.saver.sit)  (expand archive and put it in "~/Library/Screen Savers").
- Get the [source code](http://kurup.org/files/borkware-drip-vkurup-11.tar.gz).
