If you'll scroll down a bit, back to June 28th, 2001, you'll see that I promised 'Video' of the wedding of Gerry and Kim. Go ahead, scroll... I'll wait.





Back? OK... I actually said 'Video at 11', but I didn't specify exactly when '11' was. Well... it's now!!!! OK, so it's not exactly video, but it's a [slideshow of the festivities](http://kurup.org/files/gerry-kim-wedding.mov) (4.6 Mb).
