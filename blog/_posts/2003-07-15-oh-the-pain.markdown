Ugh... I woke up this morning with a nagging pain in my right knee. It kinda improved through the day, so I wasn't too worried about it, but when I tried to run on it this evening, it really hurt. So I'm gonna keep to the bike for awhile. I remember having this problem (which I think is [patellar tendonitis](http://www.emedx.com/emedx/diagnosis_information/knee_disorders/patellar_tendonitis_outline.htm)) during the [last marathon](/blog/2000/10/23/marathon) and I remember that it got better pretty quick, so I'm praying it's the same this time.
