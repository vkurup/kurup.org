I used to be a primary care physician, but switched to being a hospitalist
in 2007. I loved parts about being a PCP, namely the relationship that I
developed with the patient over many years. I miss that. I think PCPs offer
huge value in providing low cost, quality care, especially if they can stay
engaged throughout the hospitalization process. Atul Gawande recently wrote
[a powerful article on the Hospice system](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/02/100802fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all). It's
worth reading to being to understand the complex issues involved in
end-of-life care, not to mention for the emotional storytelling that is his
strength. But, to me, the unsung hero in that story was Chuck Morris, the
primary care physician, who came in at the proper moment and provided
perspective to the patient that he knew so well, allowing them to make the
sane, yet horribly difficult decision to pursue a palliative path. Reading
that made me miss primary care medicine a little. I perform much more
actual "medical" work as a hospitalist than I ever did as a PCP. But, when
I think of the concept of a *doctor*, in my head, I'm thinking of a primary
care doc.
