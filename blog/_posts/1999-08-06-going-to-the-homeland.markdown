I found out recently that I'll be spending 3 weeks (maybe longer) in Green Bay, WI. I'll be working as a hospitalist at St. Vincent's Hospital (Prevea HealthCare). It's a 580 bed hospital with 40 ICU beds and I'll be doing 12 hour shifts - mostly day shifts, but a couple nights. It should be fun! I'm looking forward to being back in Wisconsin, especially Green Bay, for football season. Go PACKERS!!
