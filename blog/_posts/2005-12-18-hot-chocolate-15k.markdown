I ran the NYRR Hot Chocolate 15K (9.3 miles) this morning. It was cold, but then again, it's the middle of December, so whaddya expect? I've only run twice since the marathon, so I took it nice and easy. I planned to run about 10 minute miles, but I felt good around mile 5, so I sped up. I finished in 1:25:22 (9:10 per mile).

Oh yeah... and the Hot Chocolate was awesome!
