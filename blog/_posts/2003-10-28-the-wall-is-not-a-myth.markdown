title: The Wall is not a myth
tags: running marathon race
---

I ran the [Marine Corps Marathon](http://marinemarathon.com) yesterday
and can now confirm that [Hitting the
Wall](http://www.badwaterultra.com/training/bane.html) is a real
phenomenon. I finished about 5 minutes faster than I did in Chicago
(2000), but I was really hoping to break 4:30. Everything was going
great through the halfway point (2:11:48 - 10:04 mpm) when a few
doubts started to creep into my head. I'm only halfway? I gotta do
this again? Somehow I was able to make it through to mile 17 at
2:55:30 (10:19 mpm) before things really fell apart. I remember it
clearly yesterday and it seemed to be an instant replay from
Chicago. I started thinking about how much further I had to go and how
tired I already was. Then I think, well, maybe I need to rest up so I
can finish strong, huh? Maybe I should walk through the next water
break - that won't be such a bad thing, right? And then the next thing
I know, I'm walking more than I'm running. Once I start walking, I'm
done. The key is not to think about how much further you have to go,
but rather to take it one step at a time, but that's obviously easier
said than done. The marathon is not a rational thing - if you think
about it and you let your rational mind make decisions for you, you'll
never accomplish your goal.

I'm still quite happy with finishing. I'm sore all over, but in that
satisfying kinda way. I was able to take the train home yesterday and
even made it to work today. And unlike 2000, I'm motivated to keep
running, although I'm going to stay away from marathoning for a
while. My left brain isn't ready for it.

<p><b>Metaphor of life</b></p>

Hi Vinu,  Congratulations on the race.  I fully agree with everything
you said.  You know what I thought about the Marathon that I ran in
Chicago... it is really a metaphor of life... just like you said
taking things step by step.  I saw an advertisement of the Boston
Marathon I think that went something like this... there is nothing you
can't learn about yourself that you can't learn in 26.2 miles.  I was
really amazed at the diversity of people who were runnng.  There were
people who really looked out of shape running at a significantly
faster pace that I could imagine they could run.  I remember a guy
dressed up in a clown suit passing me up and the two guys that ran
with me most of the way.  One of the guys said "we can't let a clown
pass us" to which the other replied "oh yes we can."  I do agree that
the marathon takes a lot out of you both mentally and physically.  My
knees still ache a bit when I run.  I don't know though, it can
certainly be addictive.  I look forward to seeing you to talk about
our marathon experiences.

It's funny - Harish and I had the same "metaphor for life"
conversation when we were running together in Indianapolis last
weekend.
