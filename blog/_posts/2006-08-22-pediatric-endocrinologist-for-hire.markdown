Mala finishes her fellowship in July 2007, so we've entered job search mode. We've got a few interviews scheduled, but it just seems harder than it should be to find out who has positions available.

Some criteria:

- focus on clinical practice
- location with a lower cost of living than NYC (I guess that rules out ... NYC)
- friendly colleagues, staff, environment
- family friendly
- location near friends or family

So if you know of someone that needs hard-working, intelligent, caring pediatric endocrinologist, let me know. Act now and we'll throw in a computer-programming, marathon-running internist!
