Cousins Trip 2005 ([photos](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=20907)) was in Lake George, NY this year. The weather didn't quite cooperate this time. It was cloudy and rainy all week. Still, we were able to get in a [great hike](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=21090), [some competitive bowling](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=21654), [basketball](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=21990) and mini-golf, not to mention enjoying the [2nd annual Elvis Festival](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=21486). While we didn't run into any bears, we did see [plenty](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=21798) [of](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=21294) [wildlife](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=21450). Of course, I would be a rumpcake if I were to forget to mention our late-night Taboo contests, the highlight of the trip.
