Life has been moving too quickly for me to document my menial
existence. Check back again soon when my existence is not so menial!
In the meantime, here's a Cliff Note's version (may Cliff rest in
peace) of the past 5 months (in no particular order).

- I left medicalrecords.com
- I began doing freelance web development
- I finished a Palm-based interface for [The Answer Page](http://www.theanswerpage.com)
- I began moonlighting at MIT's After Hours Medical Center, thus getting in touch with my "medical" side again.
- I've begun helping out with the [OpenACS 4 project](http://openacs.org/4) and have so far ported the Notes module, Download module and Ticket-Tracker-Lite module.
- My [grandmother](/images/Amma.jpg) passed away at the age of 91 on March 31, 2001. She was a strong vibrant woman and remained that way up until her passing. 
- My cousin Deepu matched at UCSF for internal medicine!!! What a stud! Of course, I'm only saying that so he'll let me stay with him when I visit SF :-)
- My cousins and I went sea kayaking in North Carolina and survived! Physical effort, natural beauty and comraderie combined to make it a perfect weekend away from the daily grind.
- We celebrated my roommate Gerry's bachelor party in Miami. Enough said ;-)
- My brother [Manu](http://kurup.net) got a sweet job at Harley Davidson!!! He'll be travelling to places like Japan, Brazil and Australia and taking his little brother with him (hint, hint)
- A bunch of other stuff happened, but my fingers are getting tired.
