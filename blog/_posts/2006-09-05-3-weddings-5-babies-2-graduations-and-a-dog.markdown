I love taking pictures with my trusty old Canon S200. It takes great pics and I get to take the credit. I'm just horrible about getting them off my camera and onto my website. I finally uploaded a [whole bunch](http://kurup.org/photo/?folder_id=61013) today, dating back to early May when we went to [Philadelphia for Kevin and Joanne's wedding](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71973). The next group is from [Brooklyn and Staten Island for Mary Ann and Benjeil's wedding](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71975). We interrupted wedding season to watch [Ethan graduate from law school](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71979) in Minneapolis. While in the Twin Cities, we got to spend a few minutes with [Ajay](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=73510). Back home, we started [Memorial Day in the Cloisters](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71981), had lunch in the city (photo above), and finished the day by meeting a cute girl named [Amalie](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=73401) (of Amalie &amp; Ivory fame!). A week later we were back in the Midwest for [Sivan's cozy high school graduation](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71983). Nothing like watching your nephew graduate from high school to make you feel old. [Mike and Susan threw a barbecue in Long Island](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=74486) to celebrate their farewell. [Asha](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=74502) was there too! Next up on the wedding circuit were [Russ and Michelle](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71985). They were nice enough to get married in DC, so we were able to stay with Puja and meet [Loki](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=74305). [Mala interviewed in Norfolk](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71987) where we were introduced to [Kylee](http://kurup.org/photo/photo?photo_id=74063) for the first time.

And if that's not enough for you, here are some [random pics from the Bronx](http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=71977). I'm sad to say that I've yet to take any photos of [Hunter June](http://kurup.org/dave/photo/photo?photo_id=71894), so I'll point you instead to [her parents' photos](http://kurup.org/dave/photo/album?album_id=67042).
