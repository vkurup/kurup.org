<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of great plans which I&#8217;ve never fulfilled. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. My life is beyond great and I see it getting better every day. There just happen to be a lot of things that I&#8217;ve planned to do which I have not done.</p>

<p>I planned to create a web-based running log. I actually did do this and used it for a long time, but I never did build in enough features to make it worthwhile for others to use. Or even enough to make it exciting for me to use.</p>

<p>I planned to create a system to help me keep track of my finances. Something that would give me a snapshot of where we are now while also letting me know if we were on track for where we want to be. I am meticulous about recording all of our financial transactions (in a great program called <a href='http://www.newartisans.com/blog/projects/ledger.html'>ledger</a>), but I haven&#8217;t taken the next step to easily and simply analyze that data.</p>

<p>I planned to create checklists that would make it easier to do my daily work in the hospital. There are certain things that I do everyday, or for every patient, that from time to time I forget. It&#8217;s not even that I necessarily forget it. Sometimes, I just don&#8217;t remember if I did it, so I have to go back and check, often finding that I <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> forget. Following a checklist would remove that doubt.</p>

<p>I planned to make my website really reflect me. It would have more stuff about my interests and the things that are happening in our lives. I read a lot and think a little and I&#8217;m sure some of these insights, however mundane, might help someone else who happens to be thinking about the same thing.</p>

<p>I planned to create a website for our family. A place where anyone in the family could create their own space to do whatever they want. A place where we could document and investigate our family tree and our family history. I actually built some of this over 10 years ago but took it down because I needed to password protect it (at the request of some family members). It&#8217;s now more than 10 years later and I haven&#8217;t done that simple task.</p>

<p>I planned to create a <a href='http://vikurup.com/'>website for my father</a> which would talk about the great things that he has done in the world of science and now in the world of religion. Fortunately, he beat me to it, but I want to make his site even better.</p>

<p>I planned to create a website for my brother-in-law, Ethan, who is starting an <a href='http://www.lawbeattie.com/'>immigration law practice here in Durham, NC</a>. This finally got done, but there are so many things to do to make it better.</p>

<p>These are just a tiny percentage of the failed projects on my list. What&#8217;s the point of all of this &#8216;woulda shoulda coulda&#8217;? I just read a great article over at defmacro.com called &#8221;<a href='http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/taming-perfectionism.html'>Taming Perfectionism</a>&#8221;. It&#8217;s about me. OK, I&#8217;m not 100% sure he meant to write about me, but that description is me. All of these projects that I listed are relatively simple. The reason they&#8217;re not done is because whenever I think about them, I start to get overwhelmed. I cannot begin to work on one detail without thinking about the perfect way to implement that detail. Let&#8217;s make a running log. OK, but first, let&#8217;s model the database. Is that third-normal form? Hmmm&#8230; I wonder if I should write the unit tests before the database. Let me google &#8216;unit testing software&#8217;. And before you know it, I&#8217;m back to my RSS reader to do some passive reading. On that vein, I happened to find this little video on <a href='http://www.43folders.com/'>43Folders</a> at the same time that I read the &#8220;Taming Perfectionism&#8221; article. It&#8217;s an oldie by <a href='http://www.zefrank.com/'>Ze Frank</a>, who is amazing:</p>
<object data='http://blip.tv/play/AYqRV4L5WQ' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' height='278' width='350'><param name='src' value='http://blip.tv/play/AYqRV4L5WQ' /><param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /></object>
<p>So, I feel like the internets are conspiring to get me to drop my perfectionism. And writing this article is my first step. I won&#8217;t get everything on my todo list done, but I&#8217;m going to make an effort to be a little more imperfect. I hope you don&#8217;t mind.</p>
