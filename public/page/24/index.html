          <p>I got home as it was getting dark, so I ran at the gym, on the
treadmill. I usually hate running indoors, but running on the
treadmill has one huge positive point. You don&rsquo;t have to pay attention
where you&rsquo;re going. I got myself into a groove and before I knew it, I
was done with my 5 miles in about 47 minutes. Much faster than I was
just a few months ago!</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been getting weird emails over the past day or so. The <code>From:</code> address is always different, there is no body text and there is an attachment called <code>your_document.pif</code>. The <code>From:</code> address is sometimes recognizable, but seems to be spoofed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=your_document.pif">Google only gave me 1 document for &ldquo;your_document.pif&rdquo;</a> and that document states that <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/sobig_f.shtml">this is a new virus called W32/Sobig.F-mm</a> (link changed due to 404). Not much info about it yet, but it seems pretty widespread.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Wow, google only had 1 document for the above search when I wrote this a few hours ago and now it has 391! Looks like this virus is just taking off. <a href="http://www.local6.com/news/2420899/detail.html">Fastest. Virus. Ever.</a></p>

<p><b>Sobig.F</b></p>
<p>
According to an article in today's paper (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
8/21/03) This was called the fastest growing virus ever by MessageLabs
Inc. It halted CSX Transportation trains in Washington DC and infected
more than 2000 computers at the University of Wisconsin Madison.  It
infects PC's running Microsoft Windows, and turns PCs into relayers of
spam e-mail clogging computer servers on the internet and crashing
networks.  The subject line could say "Details", Thank You", or
"Wicked screensaver". The virus doesn't appear to be destroying data
or causing other lasting damage to the machines or networks it has
infected.  You just have to face the daunting task of deleting a ton
of virus e-mails.

<p>The power finally came back on at around 7:20 PM tonight. I was
sitting on my futon trying as hard as I could not to sweat, when I
heard a loud cheer from the courtyard and saw that the lights had gone
on in the apartments outside my window.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a weird couple of days. The power went out around 4:15 PM
yesterday while I was looking up some labs in the preceptor&rsquo;s
room. The A/C had been on full-blast, so we all thought that it was
just an overloaded circuit, but soon we got word that nearby buildings
were affected and everyone went smoothly into disaster-mode. Take care
of any urgent patient needs and encourage everyone else to go home. No
staff leaves until we know what&rsquo;s going on. Around 6:30, we got the
word that whoever was within walking distance could go home, provided
that they be back first thing in the morning. I figured 4 miles is
walking-distance, so I left. From the 80&rsquo;s to around 63rd St, 2nd
Avenue was packed with cars trying in vain to get to the Queensboro
bridge. Traffic lights were off, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter since
the cars weren&rsquo;t moving anyway. Civilians were trying to direct
traffic with varying success. The cars obeyed, but pedestrians were on
their own schedule. From the Queensboro down to the 40&rsquo;s, pedestrians
replaced the cars and swarmed over the street.</p>

<p>I got to my neighborhood around 8ish. Most of the local shops were out
of flashlights and running low on water. I swear the people at the
counter were just making up prices as they went along, but no one
really seemed to care. After getting settled at home, I went for a
short walk outside around 10PM. I was shocked at how dark New York was
without any lights. You could clearly see the stars in the sky. It was
dangerous to walk around without a flashlight because there would be
people just sitting on the sidewalk waiting to be tripped over.</p>

<p>But everything is back to normal now and the only casualty is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime">uptime</a></p>

          <p>An article in the NY Times claims that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/science/12MAIL.html">&lsquo;6 degrees of separation&rsquo; is an exaggeration</a>. They tested it by asking people to forward emails to people that they knew in hopes that the chain would eventually lead to 1 of the researchers&rsquo; destinations. I know that I delete any chain mail that I get, so I&rsquo;m not sure that the study&rsquo;s results are valid.</p>

<p>Let me provide an anecdotal rebuttal. I went to <a href="http://www.archana-subhasis.us/">Subha and Archana&rsquo;s wedding</a> in Chicago last weekend and I&rsquo;m guessing there were 400 people there. I met about 20 people whom I hadn&rsquo;t met before. Of those, 2 had links to me through people who had nothing to do with the wedding. One was a cousin of Sushil, my good buddy from Boston. The other one is a little more convoluted. My cousin Deepu was the inspiration for the name of a musical group when he was at Wash U in St. Louis. Deepu has since moved on to San Fran, so the group has changed its name. A person I met at the wedding is currently a member of that group and has always wanted to meet the infamous Deepu, whose name is plastered over the other members&rsquo; instruments.</p>

<p>Now, does being connected through a band&rsquo;s name count as a degree of separation?</p>
