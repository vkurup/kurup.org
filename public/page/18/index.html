<blockquote>
<p>Hey Vin, what do you think of SBG (Sinclair Broadcast Group) Its the company that owns Channels 18 and 24(my employer). Andy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took a quick look at SBGI and would probably avoid it. The first place I always look is the market cap. At 700 million, it&rsquo;s a little bigger than the companies I&rsquo;m investing in. The second place I look is the balance sheet and SBGI&rsquo;s scares me. It has a current ratio less than 2 (current assets divided by current liabilities). This means that they don&rsquo;t have much leeway in paying off bills due in the next year in a worst-case scenario. More than half of their assets are intangible assets (goodwill, etc). Basically, these are considered assets in an accounting sense, but aren&rsquo;t tangible. Sometimes intangible assets are very valuable (for example, Coke&rsquo;s brand name), but usually they aren&rsquo;t. They also have a huge amount of debt which, although common in the broadcast industry, makes them riskier. This combination of factors makes their tangible book value negative. That means that if the company goes under for any reason, the chances of stockholders getting anything is unlikely.</p>

<p>Basically, I look for small companies (less than 500 million market cap), with strong balance sheets, priced cheap (P/B less than 1.5) and with improving fundamentals. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that SBGI won&rsquo;t do well. It might, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit into my strategy.</p>

          <p>I try to do my portfolio cleanup every 3 months, selling any companies that don&rsquo;t fit my strategy and buying new ones that do. So, I&rsquo;m selling 5 stocks. I haven&rsquo;t decided on my buys yet, but I&rsquo;m looking at BAMM, BZ, CALM, ESP, PWX, SCX and SRT (among others).</p>

<td>I probably should&rsquo;ve sold this back in February or May when it was in the 11&rsquo;s. Instead I sold it about where I bought it at $8. Still undervalued, but its fundamentals aren&rsquo;t as promising as they were a year ago. They&rsquo;ve taken on an acquisition which seems a little outside their circle of competence. They&rsquo;re a golf clothing company and they bought a hat company specializing in college sports and NASCAR. Doesn&rsquo;t quite fit. Share count is increasing, no free cash flow, taking on more debt, return on assets decreasing, CFO left. I claim failure on this one.</td>

<td>It&rsquo;s hard to sell a stock that has been on such a run, but it&rsquo;s even harder to watch a stock tank when you knew you should have sold. Of course, I have no way of knowing if BMHC will tank, but I do know that it doesn&rsquo;t meet my criteria for a stock in my portfolio. I bought this last year because I noticed that it had a PE ratio &lt; 10, a P/B ratio near 1, and it was paying a dividend. The P/B ratio is now over 3, so it&rsquo;s no longer such a great value. It&rsquo;s benefitted from the great housing market nationwide, but I don&rsquo;t think that can last forever. Again, BMHC may go up from here, but that&rsquo;s OK because I&rsquo;m only interested in owning stocks that fit into my philosophy - small and cheap.</td>

They still have no information on why the auditor quit. They&rsquo;re hiring 2 big-4 accounting firms to help with compliance, in addition to another auditor for their general financial statements. I also don&rsquo;t quite understand how to evaluate financial companies, so I&rsquo;m bowing out now.</td>

<td align="right">-2.00%</td>
<td>I bought this before I&rsquo;d decided to focus on small caps. Merck just doesn&rsquo;t fit into my philosophy (small value). I think the Vioxx concerns are overblown, but I also wish Merck would&rsquo;ve been more upfront with physicians from the beginning. I think taking Vioxx off the market was the right thing to do, even though I think Vioxx probably has some value in certain uses. Bottom line is that I&rsquo;m a small cap investor, so no more Merck.</td>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Cobra Industries (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBR">COBR</a>) announced their second quarter results today. I bought COBR in February 2005 because they seemed really undervalued (based on Price/Book and Price/Earnings ratios). They make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Band">CB radios</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_way_radio">2-way radios</a>, radar detectors, and are starting to make handheld GPS devices. Cobra owns around 60% of the CB radio market, 20% of the 2-way radio market and 60% of the radar-detector market. They&rsquo;ve just started in the GPS market and their major product, the NavOne 3000, seems like a flop so far.</p>

<p>This quarter, their revenue and earning were way up and the stock price jumped 25% today (Woo hoo!). I listened to the conference call and here are my thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Revenue up 34%, especially from Radio Shack and Walmart. Demand seems good through the rest of this year.</li>
<li>Gross margin was down slightly because some retailers were experiencing high demand and were running out of product, so they had to specially ship extra inventory, at a higher freight cost. Margins should return next quarter.</li>
<li>Current GPS device (<a href="http://www.cobraelectronics.com/navone/index.php">NavOne 3000</a>) was not well received, partly because it didn&rsquo;t have a touch screen. Management says they identified this shortcoming initially but that the cost of developing a touch screen through their vendor at the time was too high. Now they realize that it&rsquo;s important. Makes me wonder about their product development skills, but I&rsquo;m also glad to see the honesty and the learning process.</li>
<li>New GPS device (NavOne 4500, due out this quarter) will have real-time traffic info for 45 metro areas (covering <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of US population). It&rsquo;s apparently the only device currently on the market to have that.</li>
<li>Accounts receivables were up compared to same time last year, but are down from end of year 2004. It&rsquo;s not much out of line with increase in revenue.</li>
<li>No debt</li>
<li>Book value is now over $10 per share. Even after the run up today, the market price is still below book value.</li>
<li>Cash is up. You&rsquo;d think this would be a good thing, but whenever a company starts piling up cash, they start talking about &hellip; acquisitions. Management wants to take advantage of their current distribution channels with a new product. They don&rsquo;t think there is much room for internal growth. Acquisitions are troublesome, because they&rsquo;re difficult to do properly and because there&rsquo;s so much management incentive to do them. In addition, it&rsquo;s difficult for the outside investor to see how an acquisition is really doing. I&rsquo;d rather see them doing a dividend or a buyback and focusing on internal growth.</li>
<li>Share count did not increase this quarter. This is so rare to see these days. Almost every company seems to be doling out options, thus diluting current shareholders out. It&rsquo;s even worse to see them doing this when their market price is so low. I&rsquo;m happy to see that COBR didn&rsquo;t dilute (at least this quarter)</li>
<li>SG &amp; A decreased as a percent of sales. Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs should decrease next quarter and beyond. Sarbanes-Oxley is the new post-Enron/WorldCom legislation aimed at keeping companies honest. It&rsquo;s apparently quite cumbersome and expensive, especially for small public companies. Thus, the rationale for the next item&hellip;</li>
<li>Management responded to an analyst who suggested the company should be taken private by saying, &ldquo;We understand your rationale, but this isn&rsquo;t the appropriate place to talk about it.&rdquo; (paraphrased). It sounded to me like management agrees, but I&rsquo;m still a newbie at these conference calls.</li>
<li>Company stated that a buyback may be a good idea, but they want an acquisition first.</li>
<li>I liked the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the management team from the conference call.</li>
</ul>

<p>I bought COBR around 7.50, so the 25% pop puts me nicely into the green. The acquisition issue is a red flag and I&rsquo;ll definitely analyze that data once it&rsquo;s available, but for the moment I&rsquo;m holding.</p>

          <p><img class="inset right" src="/images/bronx-half.jpg" height="500" width="333" alt="Finishing the Bronx Half Marathon" /></p>

<p>I ran the <a href="http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a50710&amp;amp;result.year=2005">Bronx Half-Marathon</a> on Sunday in 2:07:05. I ran the same race last year in 2:07:02. How&rsquo;s that for consistent?. Of course, I&rsquo;d rather be consistently <em>fast</em> than consistently <em>slow</em>, but I&rsquo;m trying to look on the bright side. By the way, I really do enjoy these races more than my pictures would suggest :-)</p>

<p>We started near Lehman College and ran along beautiful tree-lined streets like Sedgwick Avenue and Mosholu Parkway. The course does a few U-turns, so you get to see the leaders coming back. That&rsquo;s always motivating for me. The only annoying stretch is the out and back down the middle of the sun-exposed Grand Concourse. On a bright sunny day, that really drains you.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been running consistenly, so I didn&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;d be setting any records. I&rsquo;m happy with 2:07. I just need to get in gear and be more consistent with my weekly mileage. I&rsquo;m following the <a href="http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/training/trainingschedule.php">NYRR Marathon - Casual Marathoner guide</a>. This week I&rsquo;m supposed to run 24 miles. I&rsquo;ve got 15 down so far with a <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/race/2005/r0716x00.php">5 mile race (Dash &amp; Splash)</a> planned on Saturday.</p>

<p>Cousins Trip 2005 (<a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album_id=20907">photos</a>) was in Lake George, NY this year. The weather didn&rsquo;t quite cooperate this time. It was cloudy and rainy all week. Still, we were able to get in a <a href="/images/lake-george-hike.jpg">great hike</a>, <a href="/images/lake-george-bowling.jpg">some competitive bowling</a>, <a href="/images/bball.jpg">basketball</a> and mini-golf, not to mention enjoying the <a href="/images/elvis.jpg">2nd annual Elvis Festival</a>. While we didn&rsquo;t run into any bears, we did see <a href="/images/caterpillar.jpg">plenty</a> <a href="/images/gecko.jpg">of</a> <a href="/images/snake.jpg">wildlife</a>. Of course, I would be a rumpcake if I were to forget to mention our late-night Taboo contests, the highlight of the trip.</p>

          <p>I admit it. As a runner, I&rsquo;m obsessive about my mileage. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m obsessive about running and getting my mileage in. That would be a good thing. Once I do go for a run, I&rsquo;m obsessive about knowing exactly how far I&rsquo;ve run.</p>

<p>In high school, I&rsquo;d finish my run and then promptly jump on my 10-speed bike which had an odometer, so I could measure how far I&rsquo;d gone. In college, I got lazy and started using my car for the same purpose. Then someone invented the internet and surfing <a href="http://www.mapquest.com">MapQuest</a> became my routine post-run activity. I&rsquo;d spend more time trying to find out how long my run was than I actually did running.</p>

<p>During my training for the 2003 <a href="http://www.marinemarathon.com">Marine Corps Marathon</a>, I bought a <a href="http://www.timex.com/spd/products.html">Timex GPS watch</a> to calculate my mileage. I thought this would be the holy grail of running measurement, but unfortunately it was quite inaccurate in Manhattan. Everytime I ran through Battery Park and past Ground Zero, the miles would click off like I was a Kenyan marathoner. It once told me that I had run 3 miles in under 12 minutes.</p>

<p>Over time, I&rsquo;ve become a little less obsessive, to the point that I now estimate my mileage by dividing my run time by my perceived pace. So just as I&rsquo;m shedding the last vestiges of obsessive-compulsive disorder, what do I find? <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/">Google Pedometer</a>. Someone took Google Maps and hacked it to allow people to measure distances between multiple points. Just double click on your starting point, click &lsquo;Start Recording&rsquo; and then double click your way along your route as the miles accumulate at the top left. Very cool.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.footnoted.org">Footnoted.org</a> is a blog that delves into SEC filings looking for those juicy details that companies are trying to hide from investors. Mainly, these details include things like excessive executive compensation or shady related-party transactions. You don&rsquo;t want companies that you&rsquo;re invested in to show up on her blog (except on Fridays when she tries to find companies that are doing responsible things).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.footnoted.org/not-adding-up/">Footnoted.org recently highlighted Flagstar Bank</a> (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&amp;amp;s=FBC">FBC</a>) because they&rsquo;ve announced that their auditor resigned, their CFO resigned without citing a reason, and finally that he was still being paid as a consultant at a higher salary than he was as an employee ($60,000 per month vs $30,000 per month). Shady stuff. All of the above is true, but CFO Michael Carrie actually announced that he was retiring way back in April and at that time the <a href="http://www.flagstar.com/inside/article.jsp?article=4516998959&amp;amp;type=1">press release</a> documented that it was to &ldquo;pursue personal interests&rdquo;. CEO Thomas Hammond gave him some glowing praise in that press release,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He has served the Bank well, and we are pleased that he has agreed to remain on the Board so that the Company can continue to benefit from his knowledge  and experience in his capacity as a director and financial advisor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His retirement as CFO was planned to be on June 20th, 2005, but he was supposed to stay on the board. On June 22nd, 2005, we got the press release stating that he was also retiring from the board, but would remain as a highly paid consultant.</p>

<p>I bought FBC in November 2004 at around $20.80 per share with a 5% dividend at the time. It&rsquo;s now sitting near $19. Their earnings had been growing significantly over the past few years because of the booming housing market, but they&rsquo;ve plateaued now, as expected. I listened to one of the initial conference calls and the CEO and team seemed to be reasonable. They were honest about the fact that mortgage business would be declining and that they were focused on a conservative strategy. But, I wish I knew what was going on with the auditor and the CFO issue. I can understand resigning as CFO for personal reasons, but then why stand for election to the board in May just to resign in June.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m holding for now, but I may sell if anything else spooks me.</p>
