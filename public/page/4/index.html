<p><a href="http://phonegap.com">Phonegap</a> is a tool that allows you to develop
apps in HTML5 + javascript and makes it easy to deploy them to
multiple mobile platforms, including Android and iOS.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> is a dialect
of the awesome language, <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>, that compiles to
Javascript (after a pass through the <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Google Closure</a> optimizer). Because Clojure,
ClojureScript and Google Closure can be confusing terms, I&rsquo;ll use CLJS
instead of ClojureScript for the remainder of this post.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do: Write a simple CLJS app that runs on my Android
phone using these tools.</p>

<h3 id="get-helloworld-working-with-phonegap">Get HelloWorld working with PhoneGap</h3>

<p>Following <a href="http://phonegap.com/start#android">these instructions</a> will
get the Android SDK, Eclipse plugin and PhoneGap working. If you
already have the Android SDK, you&rsquo;ll be able to skip most of it. I&rsquo;m
most comfortable in Emacs, so I&rsquo;ll be using that instead of
Eclipse. Here is the command-line command for creating your project
(the <code>-t</code> refers to your android target which you can find by doing
<code>android list avds</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$ android create project -n HelloPhoneGap -t 2 -p HelloPhoneGap -k com.phonegap.helloworld -a App
</code></pre>

<p>By the end of these instructions, you should have a copy of an app
called HelloPhoneGap on your phone which, when clicked, shows a
&lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; screen.</p>

<h3 id="setup-cljs">Setup CLJS</h3>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start">simple instructions</a>,
recreated here because they&rsquo;re just so simple.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/clojure/clojurescript.git
$ cd clojurescript
$ ./script/bootstrap
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. The CLJS compiler and REPL are ready to work.</p>

<h3 id="get-helloworld-working-via-html">Get HelloWorld working via HTML</h3>

<p>Follow the
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start">instructions</a>
under the heading <em>Using ClojureScript on a Web Page</em> to build a
Javascript file and associated HTML file for testing.</p>

<h3 id="put-cljs-and-phonegap-together">Put CLJS and PhoneGap together</h3>

<p>OK, let&rsquo;s make something a little interactive on the phone. I&rsquo;m going
to build a BMI calculator that takes a person&rsquo;s height and weight in
Imperial (i.e. American) units and calculates a Body Mass Index. BMI
is simply weight divided by the square of height, with units of
kg/m<super>2</super>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the CLJS file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">    (<span style="color:#268bd2">ns </span><span style="color:#268bd2">bmi</span>)

      (<span style="color:#b58900">/ </span><span style="color:#268bd2">lbs</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">2.2</span>))
    
    (<span style="color:#268bd2">defn </span><span style="color:#268bd2">bmi</span> [<span style="color:#268bd2">h</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">w</span>]
      (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/Math.round</span> (<span style="color:#b58900">/ </span><span style="color:#268bd2">w</span> (<span style="color:#b58900">* </span><span style="color:#268bd2">h</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">h</span>))))
    
    (<span style="color:#268bd2">defn </span><span style="color:#719e07">^</span><span style="color:#2aa198">:export</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">alertDismissed</span> []
      <span style="color:#268bd2">nil</span>)
    
    (<span style="color:#268bd2">defn </span><span style="color:#719e07">^</span><span style="color:#2aa198">:export</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">displaybmi</span> [<span style="color:#268bd2">form</span>]
      (<span style="color:#719e07">let </span>[<span style="color:#268bd2">h</span> (<span style="color:#268bd2">height</span> (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/parseInt</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">form.f.value</span>) (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/parseInt</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">form.i.value</span>))
            <span style="color:#268bd2">w</span> (<span style="color:#268bd2">weight</span> (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/parseInt</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">form.l.value</span>))]
        (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/navigator.notification.alert</span> (<span style="color:#268bd2">bmi</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">h</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">w</span>) <span style="color:#268bd2">hello.alertDismissed</span>)))</code></pre></div>
<p>Basically, we create simple functions to convert Imperial heights and
weights to metric values, calculate a BMI and then use <code>displaybmi</code> to
parse form parameters, calculate the BMI and show that result in an
Android notification popup. <code>alertDismissed</code> is a callback that gets
called when the user dismisses the notification. (I&rsquo;m just discarding
the information here). Those are the only 2 functions that are needed
by the HTML file, so those are the only 2 that need the <code>:export</code>
metadata tag. <code>navigator.notification.alert</code> is a PhoneGap API call
that does the actual notification.</p>

<p>The calls prefixed by <code>js/</code> are understood by the CLJS compiler to
refer to the global JavaScript namespace. If you didn&rsquo;t include that
prefix, the compiler would assume you meant a call in the local
<code>bmi</code> namespace, which would obviously fail.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the HTML file (in <code>HelloPhoneGap/assets/www/</code>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="color:#719e07">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</span>

<p>Now compile the CLJS and move the compiled JS file to
<code>HelloPhoneGap/assets/www/</code></p>

<pre><code>$ ./bin/cljsc bmi.cljs '{:optimizations :simple :pretty-print true}' &gt; bmi.js
$ cp bmi.js ~/dev/HelloPhoneGap/assets/www/
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>:simple</code> value for optimizations and the <code>true</code> value for
pretty-print make it so that we can read the resulting JS file, but
can be changed to <code>:advanced</code> and <code>false</code> respectively when ready for
production.</p>

<p>Now, go back into the HelloPhoneGap Android project and compile it and
send it to the emulator (<code>C-c C-c i</code> in emacs). You should now have a
simple BMI calculator working on Android.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>

<p>The promise of PhoneGap is that you could use similar HTML/Javascript
to create iOS versions as well, but I haven&rsquo;t done that yet. There are
tons of API calls available on both platforms which are supposed to
give you the same access that native apps have. Using ClojureScript
means you get to use a modern functional language to create your app,
while getting access to the features that only JavaScript APIs
provide.</p>

     Fixing wireless on eeePC 
  </h1>
</header>

        
          

<p>I have an ASUS eeePC 1000, running Ubuntu 10.10. Wireless worked
flawlessly at home, which is where I use it 99% of the time. On our
most recent trip, however, it wasn&rsquo;t working. It couldn&rsquo;t connect to a
WPA-secured network. Here are the relevant error messages:</p>

<pre><code>NetworkManager[770]: &lt;warn&gt; Activation (wlan0/wireless): association took too long.
NetworkManager[770]: &lt;warn&gt; (wlan0): link timed out.
NetworkManager[770]: &lt;warn&gt; Activation (wlan0) failed for access point (linksys)
NetworkManager[770]: &lt;warn&gt; Activation (wlan0) failed.
NetworkManager[770]: &lt;info&gt; (wlan0): deactivating device (reason: 0).
</code></pre>

<p>After a little googling on my phone, I found out that <a href="http://www.ctbarker.info/2010/05/ubuntu-1004-wireless-chipsets-and-wpa.html">others had this problem with the rt2860sta wireless driver</a>. Fortunately,
there is a solution, which involved downloading the source code for
the latest driver, modifying it a bit and rebuilding the driver. Here
are the instructions:</p>

<h3 id="step-1-download-the-driver">Step 1: Download the driver</h3>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/license_us.php?n=2&amp;p=0&amp;t=U0wyRnpjMlYwY3k4eU1ERXdMekEzTHpFMkwyUnZkMjVzYjJGa05qZ3hPRFUwTmpBd05DNWllakk5UFQweU1ERXdYekEzWHpFMlgxSlVNamcyTUY5TWFXNTFlRjlUVkVGZmRqSXVOQzR3TGpBdWRHRnlD">latest rt2860sta driver</a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-rename-and-extract-the-downloaded-file">Step 2: Rename and extract the downloaded file</h3>

<p>Mine was named <code>download.php</code>, but it&rsquo;s really a tar file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">vinod@ike:~ $ mkdir <span style="color:#b58900">test</span>

vinod@ike:~/test $ tar xf driver.tar 
vinod@ike:~/test $ mv 2010_07_16_RT2860_Linux_STA_v2.4.0.0 driver
vinod@ike:~/test $ <span style="color:#b58900">cd</span> driver</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="step-3-apply-patch">Step 3: Apply patch</h3>

<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/vkurup/1205291.js"></script>


<h3 id="step-4-backup-old-driver">Step 4: Backup old driver</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">vinod@ike~/test/driver/ $ sudo ifconfig wlan0 down

vinod@ike~/test/driver/ $ sudo mv /etc/Wireless/RT2860STA backup/
vinod@ike~/test/driver/ $ sudo mv /lib/modules/2.6.35-30-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/rt2860/rt2860sta.ko backup/</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="step-5-install-and-activate-new-driver">Step 5: Install and activate new driver</h3>

<p>`<code>sh
vinod@ike:~/test/driver $ sudo make install
vinod@ike:~/test/driver $ sudo depmod -a
vinod@ike:~/test/driver $ sudo modprobe rt2860sta
</code></p>

<h3 id="step-6-fix-problems-with-hibernation">Step 6: Fix problems with hibernation</h3>

<p>A separate problem is that wireless has been flaky when the computer
wakes from hibernation, but <a href="http://www.twentyways.com/2010/11/19/fixing-wireless-issues-with-asus-eeepc-1000he-running-ubuntu-10-10/">it&rsquo;s also fixable</a>.</p>

<p>Add the following lines to <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>blacklist rt2800pci
blacklist rt2800lib
blacklist rt2x00usb
blacklist rt2x00pci
blacklist rt2x00lib
</code></pre>

<p>Create a new file called <code>/etc/pm/config.d/unload_wireless</code> with the following line:</p>

<pre><code>SUSPEND_MODULES=&quot;rt2860sta&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Reboot and you should have WPA-compatible, hibernatable wireless.</p>

</span>


<p>Have you ever been in one of those dreams where everything seems
normal and then a flying car (or something equally crazy) comes out of
nowhere? I&rsquo;m used to having experiences like that when I&rsquo;m dreaming,
but it was quite surreal to have it during waking hours.</p>

<p>Mala and Kavi had gone ahead (surreptiously to plan a surprise party
for someone else!). We were to meet at the ferris wheel at the Navy
Pier. I found her and she took my hand. She started leading me through
the crowds of tourists. I could sense excitement in her demeanor, but
didn&rsquo;t think anything of it. She led me towards a group of people and
I caught a glimpse of someone who looked like my Dad. That&rsquo;s
weird&hellip; why would he be here? It&rsquo;s at that point that neurons started
to malfunction and I began to feel like I was in a dream. Then I saw
Mala&rsquo;s mom and got even more confused. Slowly the group of strangers
came into focus and revealed themselves as my friends and family from
around the country. It was, without a doubt, the best birthday present
that I have ever received, or expect to receive. Thanks to Mala for
months of planning, and for wanting to make me feel special even
though I feel this way every day when I wake up next to her. Thanks to
all my friends and family who could make it and to the ones who
couldn&rsquo;t. If this is the culmination of 40 years on this earth, I

<p>I have just had the most amazing Italian meal that I&rsquo;ve had outside of
Roberto&rsquo;s in the Bronx. Mala made fresh homemade Pappardelle and a
Bolognese sauce that she just learned at
<a href="http://www.revolutionrestaurant.com">Revolution&rsquo;s</a> cooking class. The
thing is, she made this yesterday, and I just tried it today as
leftovers and it was still amazing. This sure is going to make going
lo-carb impossible.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s probably too early to worry about this, but I often
wonder about the best way to introduce Kavi and Anika to
computers. &lsquo;Introduce&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t the right word because even Anika has
more experience with computers than I did at that age. So far, though,
computers are something that Daddy and Mommy use to do work, not
things that are for them. We&rsquo;ll show them a Sesame Street video on
YouTube or family pictures on Facebook, but they don&rsquo;t spend any
significant amount of time on it. They&rsquo;re easily entertained without
computers. I know that will change as they get older, but for now at
least, they prefer their toys and their imagination to TV or
computers. Even at their young age, that is rare.</p>

<p>The dilemma is that I <strong>do</strong> want them to learn about technology and learn
how to use it in their lives without being controlled by it. I don&rsquo;t
see anything wrong with exposing them to things like computers, iPads,
YouTube, etc., as long as it is monitored. I just want it to be a
healthy portion of their leisure time, not all of it. So many
children&rsquo;s entertainment options are spoon-fed propaganda. They are
meant to be passively enjoyed, and the child just sits and absorbs
it. The source of the content is often questionable. Advertisers for
big corporations or government trying to get their message to kids
either overtly or subtly.</p>

<p>I like my childhood experience. My first major exposure to computers
was an Apple IIe. There was nothing organized about it. I spent a
large majority of my time playing games, but those were just the
gateway drugs to get me to realize that there was much more power in
those machines. The entire experience was about tinkering. Trying
to figure out how it worked, how to make it work for me, how I could
make it do things. The most exciting days in my childhood were the
days that the inCider magazine arrived with pages of DOS code listings
in the back. Retyping those code listings, making alterations, trying
to figure out how things worked&hellip; that is much more healthy than just
watching a video over and over again. I, of course, was much older
than Kavi is now, so I&rsquo;m not too worried. I just don&rsquo;t want them to
get addicted to a certain concept of what technology is for, before
they have the skills to really take advantage of it.</p>

          <p>You may have noticed that I&rsquo;ve rearranged the furniture a little. It&rsquo;s
been almost 2 years since I last redesigned my blog, so I&rsquo;m way
overdue for a pointless redesign. I&rsquo;m now using
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> which basically takes
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and adds nice HTML5
templates, cross-browser stylesheets, jekyll plugins, and a few build
scripts to automate common tasks.</p>

<p>Enjoy my new site and let me know if you find any issues. The <a href="https://github.com/vkurup/kurup.org">source code for my site</a>, as always, is
at github. Please let me know if you have questions about it. I&rsquo;m also
taking bets on how long this design lasts.</p>

<p>Dear patients,</p>

<p>






<span class="caption-wrapper right">

  <span class="caption-text">Why We Get Fat</span>
</span>

I am sorry. I have been giving you bad dietary advice. In medical
school we learned that fat in your diet causes fat to accumulate in
your arteries, causing heart attacks and strokes, so I told you to eat
a low fat diet. Of course, looking back, we had no evidence to support
that conclusion, but it just seemed rather obvious. Obvious ideas are
often the most dangerous ideas of all. When you see a study that
<strong>might</strong> confirm your obvious idea, you give it extra weight. When
you see a study that <strong>might</strong> refute your obvious idea, you find
problems with the study. When the idea is less certain, then you tend
to give the empirical evidence more weight. This is what we&rsquo;ve done
with the hypothesis that dietary fat causes heart disease.</p>

<p>I just finished Gary Taubes&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307272702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vinodkurupshomep&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0307272702">Why We Get Fat</a>. It&rsquo;s
not a perfect book, but I do recommend it. He dispels myths about why
obesity occurs, explains what really causes it, and discusses why our
current medical and public health approaches to obesity are hurting
rather than helping. He starts out by dispelling the myth that obesity
is caused by an imbalance of &ldquo;Calories In&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Calories Out&rdquo;, and
more specifically, that obesity can be fixed by reversing that
imbalance. This is something I certainly believed. I&rsquo;ve always told
patients to eat less and exercise more. <a href="/blog/2006/10/23/health-at-every-size/">It doesn&rsquo;t work.</a> Instead of calorie
imbalance causing obesity, he states that obesity (and growth in
general) <strong>causes</strong> a calorie imbalance. The increased amount of fat
cells require more energy for sustenance, and therefore our bodies
find a way to increase the amount of calories that we take in,
compared to what we expend. So, while it is true that taking in more
calories than you expend causes your weight to go up, it is not true
that you have much control over your calorie intake or
expenditure. That&rsquo;s determined by hormones. This is the part that is
counter-intuitive. It would seem that I could control the amount of
calories that I eat or that I spend. You might have some control over
what foods you put in your mouth, buy you have no control over how the
calories are extracted or absorbed. You also have no control over the
lower level hormonal signals that make you hungry. Those signals have
evolved over millions of years to be very powerful because in
prehistoric periods, if they didn&rsquo;t work, you died. It&rsquo;s hard to
overcome that kind of evolutionary power with &ldquo;willpower&rdquo;. Even if you
are successful in decreasing the calories that you eat, your body will
naturally decrease the calories that you burn. The variables are
dependent on each other.</p>

<h2 id="the-villain-is-carbs">The villain is carbs</h2>

<p>This leads to the next question: Why do we get obese? If it&rsquo;s not a
simple matter of eating more calories than we expend, then why do we
get fat? The culprit is insulin. Insulin causes the cells of our body
to deposit fat. Insulin, in turn, is released whenever there is
glucose in our system, which is preferentially caused by carbohydrate
intake. Taubes goes into great detail about
the workings of the endocrine system, explaining why insulin is such a
powerful factor in causing fat deposition. It also explains the
phenomenon of why people who have plenty of fat still get so
ravenously hungry. Insulin prevents fat from being turned into energy
so muscle cells have to use carbohydrates, a much smaller pool of
energy. Once it runs out, intense hunger sets in and the eating cycle
starts again. Reading these chapters took me back to my med school
physiology courses. I learned all of this in med school, but we were
never taught to connect these well accepted facts with the things that
we were being taught in our dietary lectures.</p>

<p>Eliminating carbs from our diet without restricting any other nutrient
will stop the fat deposition process, which in turn will decrease our
calorie requirements, which will cause us to lose weight. There is
quite a bit of genetic variation from person to person, so some
individuals will be able to tolerate more carbs than others, and not
everyone will be completely lean even without any carbs.</p>

<p>He spends a lot of time going over the history of dietary research
dating back centuries. The danger of carbs was well understood and
accepted in all scientific and nonscientific circles until the last 50
years or so, when there was a change that attributed obesity to
behavioral weakness. This was started by the acceptance of the calorie
imbalance hypothesis. Once people accepted the thinking that taking in
more calories than you expend causes obesity, it was a short step to
blaming obesity on the individual for not controlling their diet or
exercising more. The focus of scientific research was taken off of fat
deposition and on to behavioral changes.</p>

<p>I had been coming around to this conclusion slowly over the past few
years (and am embarrassed that it has taken me this long). I remember
reading about the Atkins Diet about 10 years ago and thinking how
reckless Dr. Atkins was being by suggesting something which was so
obviously wrong. My thinking started to change a few years back when I
saw Mala struggle to lose weight despite strictly following an 800
calorie diet. I didn&rsquo;t think that kind of calorie restriction was
possible, but I watched with my own eyes as she did it and still
barely saw results. That opened my eyes, and over the past few years,
I&rsquo;ve seen more and more results with low carb diets. Results which
include weight loss, better cholesterol profiles, and overall better
health. Interestingly, the diet recommendations that are provided in
the book are from <a href="http://www.dukehealth.org/physicians/eric_c_westman">Eric Westman, MD</a>, a UW trained
physician who works just down the street from me.</p>

<p>Mala and I have been trying to get healthier over the past 8
months. My brother started a Biggest Loser competition amongst a bunch
of us, and Mala won the first season. We&rsquo;ve been exercising with more
regularity and eating better. Together, we&rsquo;ve lost over 80 lbs. To
complicate the points that I&rsquo;ve been making in this post, we have
<strong>NOT</strong> been following a strict low carb diet, and we <strong>have</strong> been
counting calories. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m certain we&rsquo;re eating less
carbs than we did before. But Mala&rsquo;s focus has been on making
delicious (gourmet!) fresh food using &ldquo;real food&rdquo; ingredients. She&rsquo;s
tried to cut processed food completely out of our diet. I think that
makes a huge difference. We&rsquo;re not meant to eat chemicals and we have
no idea what these chemicals are doing to us. Optimizing food for
specific criteria, whether that&rsquo;s low-fat, low-carb, or whatever, is
bound to have unintended consequences. In that vein, I agree with
Michael Pollan&rsquo;s recommendation to &ldquo;Eat Real Food&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At some point, I&rsquo;d like to review all the science behind the
conclusions in Taubes&rsquo; book, just so I can have a better understanding
for myself. I recommend that anyone treating patients (nurses,
doctors, nutritionists, trainers) or anyone trying to get healthier
read this book.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I love running. Wait, that&rsquo;s a lie. I love running after I&rsquo;ve finished
my run. I also love it during those periods where I get my runner&rsquo;s
high, usually around the 30 minute mark, but often it happens multiple
times after that point. I <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> love running when I&rsquo;m
contemplating going for a run. There are rare occasions where I&rsquo;m just
itching to go for a run, but usually I&rsquo;m only able start a run by
forcibly suppressing the compelling rationalizations that my brain
develops. My brain is really good at finding reasons not to run. One
trick that seems to work is to tell my brain that I have the right to
turn around when I get to the mailbox at the end of the driveway. Of
course, once I&rsquo;ve done the mechanics of getting my shoes and starting,
I never turn around. My brain is so gullible.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t love my run during the first 10 to 15 minutes. Those are
always a struggle. Always. Stretching beforehand makes it less of a
struggle, but I hate stretching, so I rarely do that. I have a few
techniques to get myself through the beginnings of my runs.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Count</strong>: Just count from 1 to 100. Once you get to a hundred, start
over. This one works the best. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s first!</li>
<li><strong>Mantra</strong>: Repeat a mantra to yourself. My favorites are: <em>Keep
covering ground</em> (inspired by my favorite running book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0915297019/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vinodkurupshomep&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0915297019">Once a Runner</a>) and <em>Just keep swimming</em>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Hkn-LSh7es" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: Start thinking about what I&rsquo;m going to eat after the
run. OK, this rarely helps, but I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</li>
<li><strong>Slow</strong>: If I&rsquo;m really feeling sluggish, then I force myself to slow
down. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, <a href="/blog/2009/09/22/running-slow/">running slow</a> is probably the most important
running technique I have. It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive, but it always
work. Running slower than I think I should always makes the run go
faster than I thought it would.</li>
<li><strong>Shorten</strong>: Shorten your stride. I aim to get 3 strides per
second, which seems really quick to me. In order to do that I shorten
my stride. I think most runners would benefit from a shorter
stride. It automatically improves your form.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, all of these are tricks to get your mind to focus on
something else besides the pain of the run. One thing that also helps
is to listen to music or podcasts. It works by the same principle of
getting your mind off the pain, but I found that my best runs were
always the ones where I left the iPod at home. It certainly makes the
beginning of the run harder, but it frees my brain up to really listen
to my body. I would otherwise find myself adjusting my pace to the
beat of the music, rather than to the pace that my body naturally
wanted to go. I also tend to have my deepest thoughts (don&rsquo;t laugh!)
when I&rsquo;m running and having music pumped in would drown those out. I
consider it my meditation practice, since I suck at real
meditation. Finally, it&rsquo;s a safety issue. When running in the woods,
you never know what kind of creature will attack:</p>

<p>Take my advice for what it&rsquo;s worth&hellip; running advice from a part-time
runner who is slower than molasses. I&rsquo;d love to hear any other running
tricks you have!</p>

          <p>Ever since my Dad brought home an Apple IIe back in 1980, I&rsquo;ve been a
huge Apple fan. The design of my website back in the mid 90&rsquo;s was a
ripoff of the Mac OS 9 System menu. (I found a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011110214204/http://kurup.com/index.phtml">later version on the Wayback Machine</a>. I
had swapped out the Apple icon for the icon of the startup I was
working with at the time.) I loved OS X for a while, especially on my
12&rdquo; Aluminum powerbook. But over time, I got more and more frustrated
by it. I wanted to be able to configure more. When the hard drive on
that Powerbook died, I decided to move to all linux.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">trying to visualize life without a mac</p>&mdash; Vinod Kurup (@vkurup) <a href="https://twitter.com/vkurup/status/1207289044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2009</a></blockquote>

<p>I am happy and productive, but I am occasionally jealous of Mac OS X. I set
up a Mac Airbook for my mother-in-law a few months ago and &hellip; can I
just drool for a minute about that computer? But, I was able to set it
up, wipe up my drool, and then return to my Ubuntu machines without
too many pangs of jealousy. For the stuff that I do, Linux works
perfectly.</p>

<p>The one pain point that I&rsquo;ve been having over the past few years is
video editing. I take a lot of movies of the kids and I like to do
some very simple editing of them before uploading them to
youtube. This was super easy in
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> back in 2007. I haven&rsquo;t
found a similar experience on Linux. It&rsquo;s reassured me a little to
hear that iMovie has gotten weaker and weaker over the years, so I
didn&rsquo;t feel any need to go back to Mac for this one function.</p>

<p>I had been using <a href="http://www.kinodv.org/">Kino</a>, but the developer
stopped working on it and it had some minor bugs. It doesn&rsquo;t play well
with PulseAudio, the overarching audio system in linux. So I had to
start it with the command <code>padsp kino</code> which allows kino to bypass
PulseAudio. That then makes all other sound on the computer stop until
I quit Kino. And with every OS update, there would be minor changes
that would require me to fiddle with the audio settings
again. Finally, I didn&rsquo;t really understand the Export settings, so my
videos were never as optimized as they could be. There were tabs for
DVD and MPEG output, but there was also one for Other and there were
MPEG options in there too. I was thoroughly confused and was hoping
for something to come along that would be better. Mark Pilgrim
mentioned OpenShot once and I looked at it back then, but I couldn&rsquo;t
figure it out. I tried valiantly for a day and then returned to
hacking on Kino.</p>

<p>Fast forward about a year and after a little more frustration with how
my videos looked on youtube, I gave
<a href="http://www.openshotvideo.com/">OpenShot</a> another try. Version 1.2 is
packaged in Ubuntu 10.10, but 1.3 offered some other nice features,
like exporting directly to Youtube, so I downloaded the
<a href="http://www.openshot.org/ppa/">PPA</a> and installed 1.3.</p>

<p>What a breath of fresh air! It was so easy to import clips. It was so
easy to place clips on the timeline. It was easy to splice and add
transitions. It was easy to add titles. Most importantly it was easy
to export to HD video format so now the videos look better on Youtube.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use Linux for its video editing capabilities. I use it because
I believe in the idea of free software and because for my purposes,
emacs and a web browser are all that I really need. But I am
pleasantly surprised when I see something like OpenShot evolve and
improve to the point that it solves my problem exactly. I will be
donating some dollars over there.</p>
