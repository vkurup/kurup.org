          <p>I spent most of this afternoon struggling with a mail issue and I didn&rsquo;t find it documented well anywhere else, so I&rsquo;m going to write about it here in the hopes that it might help someone else.</p>

<p><strong>What I was trying to do:</strong> Setup qmail + vpopmail + courier imap for imap and pop3d</p>

<p><strong>Problem I was having:</strong> For some users, checking POP3 mail would work for a while (about 5 minutes), but then would fail:</p>

<pre><code>      Jul  5 00:30:34 vkurup pop3d: LOGIN FAILED, ip=[::ffff:68.173.27.35]
      Jul  5 00:30:34 vkurup pop3d: Disconnected, ip=[::ffff:68.173.27.35]
</code></pre>

<p>The failure would only happen for users who had vpopmail accounts <strong>and</strong> shell accounts. Users who have only vpopmail accounts were fine.</p>

<p>Eventually, after much searching, I found this <a href="http://bluedot.net/mail/archive/read.php?f=2&amp;amp;i=10881&amp;amp;t=10880">message</a> which advised to configure courier-imap with <code>--without-authdaemon</code>. This solved my problem.</p>

<p>According to the author of courier-imap, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2388144&amp;amp;forum_id=33081">this problem is solved in newer versions of vpopmail</a>, but he mentions version 5.3.38 and I could only find version 5.3.20, so I didn&rsquo;t try that fix.</p>

<p><b>THANK YOU</b></p>
<p>
Thank you very much - it solved my problem !!!
</p>
<p>
pop3d was causing me serious grief, it just gave error message "pop3d: LOGIN FAILED". It's supposed to authenticate to MySQL - but according to MySQL's log, there's no query to the mail database.
</p>

<p>
Turned out I created a username in the mail database that's the same as a user in the system, as you said.
</p>

<p>
So I created another user - lo, pop3d now queries to MySQL !!
</p>

<p>
Funny thing is I've looked around the Internet for hours, and your blog is the only place that mention it.... unbelieveable.
</p>

<p>
Again, many thanks !!
</p>

<p>
cheers,

          <p>I&rsquo;m going to sign up for the <a href="http://donotcall.gov/">National Do-Not-Call Registry</a>, but I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s going to reduce the number of calls I get. Look at the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/dncalrt.htm#Exceptions">exemption list</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exempt businesses include:
- long-distance phone companies
- airlines
- banks and credit unions; and
- the business of insurance, to the extent that it is regulated by state law.</p>

<p>However, many telemarketing calls are placed by professional telemarketing companies, and even if the company whose goods or services are being sold is exempt, the telemarketing company may be covered.</p>

<p>You may still receive calls from political organizations, charities, telephone surveyors or companies with which you have an existing business relationship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The list of telemarketers who don&rsquo;t fit into the exemption list seems kinda small to me&hellip;</p>

<p><b>Get tele-zapper</b></p>
<p>
Hey Vin, you want to get rid of telemarketing calls get a tele-zapper
they work great. They're like thirty bucks and easy to hook up. I used
to get around 10 -15 calls a week and now I might get one every 3
months, and what's great is that if its a telemarketer on the line its
just silent on the line like there's nobody there so you don't have to
talk to them. It then zaps your phone number out of there system.

Hey Andy!
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the note - I had never heard about the <a
href="http://www.telezapper.com/default.asp">TeleZapper</a>
before. Does it actually emit a audible tone to anyone that calls you?
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to solve my telemarketer problem by never being home to
answer the phone :-)

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I have a love/hate relationship with <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a>. It&rsquo;s powerful way to manage services (like web servers and mail servers), but it sometimes doesn&rsquo;t act the way I expect it to.</p>

<p>Today, I tried to set up <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html">qmail-pop3d</a>. I set up a directory called <code>/var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d</code> and put a file named &lsquo;run&rsquo; inside it. This contained:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
PATH=/var/qmail/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
export PATH

tcpserver -H -R 0 pop-3 
/var/qmail/bin/qmail-popup vkurup.acornhosting.net 
/home/vpopmail/bin/vchkpw /var/qmail/bin/qmail-pop3d Maildir &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I connected the run script to my /service directory</p>

<pre><code># ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d /service
</code></pre>

<p>Then I checked to see if it was running:</p>

<pre><code># svstat /service/qmail-pop3d
/service/qmail-pop3d: up (pid 13524) 0 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmm&hellip; up 0 seconds. That&rsquo;s not right - it should be at least 5 or 6 seconds (I can&rsquo;t type <strong>that</strong> fast). That usually means that the service is repeatedly failing and restarting itself.</p>

<p>ps shows that qmail-pop3d is running, but trying to connect to port 110 doesn&rsquo;t work:</p>

<pre><code>$ telnet localhost 110
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out
</code></pre>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m stuck. Nothing is getting logged to the qmail-pop3d logs. After some headbanging, I do another <code>ps -ax</code> and this time notice a process called readproctitle:</p>

<pre><code>11919 ?        S      0:05 readproctitle service errors: ...lready used?tcpserve
r: fatal: unable to bind: address already used?tcpserver: fatal: unable to bind:
 address already used?tcpserver: fatal: unable to bind: address already used?tcp
server: fatal: unable to bind: address already used?tcpserver: fatal: unable to 
bind: address already used?tcpserver: fatal: unable to bind: address already use
d?tcpserver: fatal: unable to bind: address already used?
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s that? I look it up and find that <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/readproctitle.html">readproctitle</a> is a kind of scrolling-log for daemontools which shows up when you run <code>ps</code>. So, it looks like <code>qmail-pop3d</code> failing because it&rsquo;s trying to bind port 110 even though it&rsquo;s already been bound. So this makes me thing that <code>qmail-pop3d</code> isn&rsquo;t failing, but that it&rsquo;s running over and over again. And then I look back at my run script and look at that pesky little &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; at the end. Doh! That tells the process to detach once it starts. It starts normally, then detaches. Once it detaches, daemontools thinks it&rsquo;s down, so it tries to start it again. (At least that&rsquo;s the way I understand it). Getting rid of the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; and adding &lsquo;exec&rsquo; to the beginning fixes it and everything works now.</p>

<p>Me: 1 Daemontools: 2123</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m setting up <a href="http://inter7.com/vpopmail.html">vpopmail</a> 5.2.1 - a POP3 email manager for qmail, but it won&rsquo;t compile out of the box.</p>

<pre><code>gcc -I. -Icdb -g -O2 -Wall -c vconvert.c 
In file included from vconvert.c:35: vmysql.h:53:22: missing terminating &quot; character 
vmysql.h:60:35: missing terminating &quot; character 
make[2]: *** [vconvert.o] Error 1 
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/vpopmail-5.2.1' 
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/vpopmail-5.2.1' 
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2 
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever <code>make</code> gives you an error, look for the first error you can find. Any errors after that often fix themselves once you fix the first error.  The relevant code is here, (vmysql.h, starting at line 42):</p>

<pre><code>42: #ifdef CLEAR_PASS 
43: #define TABLE_LAYOUT &quot;pw_name char(32) not null, \ 
44: pw_domain char(64) not NULL, \ 
45: pw_passwd char(40), \ 
46: pw_uid int, pw_gid int, \ 
47: pw_gecos char(48), \ 
48: pw_dir char(160), \ 
49: pw_shell char(20), \ 
50: pw_clear_passwd char(16), \ 
51: primary key (pw_name, pw_domain ) &quot; 
52: #else 
53: #define TABLE_LAYOUT &quot;pw_name char(32) not null, \ 
54: pw_domain char(64) not null, 
55: pw_passwd char(40), \ 
56: pw_uid int, pw_gid int, \ 
57: pw_gecos char(48), \ 
58: pw_dir char(160), 
59: pw_shell char(20), \ 
60: primary key (pw_name, pw_domain ) &quot; 
61: #endif
</code></pre>

<p>Looking around line 53, I see that line 54 and line 58 are missing backslashes - adding &lsquo;em back in fixes the error. The interesting thing to me is that version 5.2.1 has been out for over a year and, according to <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/vchkpw@inter7.com/msg12238.html">an email on the vpopmail list</a>, this error still persists in more recent versions. How come this bug hasn&rsquo;t bitten anyone else? I suppose it&rsquo;s because the install docs recommend setting CLEAR_PASS (see line 42), which would cause the compiler to miss the bug. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just lucky</p>

          <p>Not all of OpenACS is Postgres 7.3 compliant yet. OpenACS 5 is compliant and the core packages in OpenACS 4.6 are compliant, but some non-core packages haven&rsquo;t been fixed yet. Noncompliant packages will complain:</p>

<pre><code>[24/Jun/2003:15:21:36][26623.196621][-conn:kurup::4] Error:  Ns_PgExec: result status: 7 message: ERROR:  Function  pa_collection__new(&quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, timestamp with time zone,  &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;) does not exist
Unable to identify a function that satisfies the given argument types
You may need to add explicit typecasts
</code></pre>

<p>It is looking for a function with <code>timestamp with time zone</code> as one of its parameters, but most OpenACS pl/pgsql functions were defined as accepting <code>timestamp</code>. In PG 7.3, <code>timestamp</code> means &lsquo;timestamp <strong>without</strong> timezone&rsquo;. <code>timestamptz</code> means &lsquo;timestamp <strong>with</strong> timezone&rsquo;. So, the quick fix, is to change <code>timestamp</code> to <code>timestamptz</code>.</p>

          <p>psql doesn&rsquo;t deal well with tabs. If you feed it a function that has tabs  in it, and then call that function, you&rsquo;ll often get this:  <code>ERROR:  parser: parse error at or near &quot;for&quot; at character 15</code>.  Thus, if you ever see this in your error log, it&rsquo;s time to <code>M-x untabify</code>.</p>

          <p>I had dinner with a friend of mine whom I hadn&rsquo;t seen in a few
months. Turned out that she had been mugged in the lobby of her
apartment in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen, so she&rsquo;s spent the last few months moving
to a safer neighborhood and dealing with all the pain that goes along
with that. How sobering. Thanks to self-defense classes that she took
in college, she was able to ultimately fight off her attacker by
pushing him away just long enough for her to scream for help.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t scream when he&rsquo;s pressed up against you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bastard actually impersonated a police officer in order to get
access to her building. Her one piece of advice for me (or anyone) -
&ldquo;Learn some self defense,&rdquo; and blowing away any myths I might have
believed, &ldquo;Men are targets as often as women because they tend to have
more money on hand.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m slowly in the process of moving my site from PHP/MySQL to OpenACS. Things are broken in the meantime. Specifically, I need to import all my old photos, steal <a href="http://badgertronics.com/blog">MarkD&rsquo;s</a> book module, and implement my family-tree module. If you find something that&rsquo;s broken, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently using an open-source stylesheet from <a href="http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/">The NYPL</a>, but I need to edit it at some point. But for now, at least, it looks better than anything I could drum up by myself.</p>

          <p>My introduction to computers came when I was about 6 or 7 years old - I
can&rsquo;t quite remember exactly when&hellip; Venu Mammen (my uncle) brought home a
terminal from work. It looked like a typewriter, but it had 2
suction-cup-thingys where you could attach a phone headset. (Phone headsets
were pretty much all the same shape back then). Venu Mammen issued some
magical command and then up on the screen came the most amazing
phrase. ADVENTURE v1.0. (Actually, I can&rsquo;t remember for sure if it was a
LED screen or if it was a dot matrix printer output - Do you remember
Manu?.) Anyway, I stayed up late that night (read: 9PM) moving around an
endless maze without really ever getting anywhere. I always sucked at
adventure games&hellip; Despite this failure, I was hooked on computers.</p>

</span>


<p>Around 1980, my father brought home a <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/zx80.html">Sinclair ZX-80</a>. This
computer had a whole 1K of RAM, and if you filled up the
RAM - no need to worry. Just hook it up to any handy portable cassette
recorder and you could save all the information you&rsquo;d ever need (well,
about 20K or so). I think my brother wrote a &lsquo;number guessing&rsquo; program&hellip; I
was so impressed.  He saved the program on a cassette tape and I still
remember trying to listen to the tape on the cassette player, half
expecting it to speak, &ldquo;Guess a number from 1 to 100.&rdquo; No luck, though -
programming apparently was a bit more complicated.</p>

</span>


<p>Some time later, we moved up to the big time (in my estimation). An
<a href="https://apple-history.com/aIIe">Apple IIe</a>
with the Apple III monitor, 1 MHz processor, 64K of RAM (which we later upgraded to 256K!!!!), 2
floppy disk drives and AppleWorks software. This computer served me throughout high school. I began
to dabble with programming in BASIC and assembly. I think that Apple is still sitting in my parents
basement. I&rsquo;ll have to see if I can load up One-on-One again&hellip;</p>

<p>My dad bought a Mac Plus for work when it came out and he let me play on it. I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing. No command line interface. A little arrow that moved in response to my movements on a &ldquo;mouse&rdquo;. Folders that you could move around. I was in heaven! I perused all the manuals that came with it trying to learn as much as I could about this new beast. Around this time, my dad asked me to help him computerize the medical testing that his lab does. I fooled around with HyperCard for about a week and wrote my first Macintosh program.</p>

<p>The first couple years of college, I was computerless. My junior year, I
decided to splurge and I bought a Mac Classic II - 4 MB RAM, 80 MB HD, 16
MHz 68030 processor. That was 1992, back in the beginning days of the
internet. It&rsquo;s pretty surprising, but this was actually marketed as a
business computer. I used that computer faithfully for 5 years. Even after
buying a new computer, I kept my old Classic II cuz I just couldn&rsquo;t bear to
sell it (especially since I&rsquo;d probably only get $20 for it). I finally
donated it to Goodwill in June of 1999.</p>

<p>In February 1997, I decided I needed a new computer. Apple was in the middle of their worst year financially - losing over $1 billion. And unfortunately, their line of computers was a reflection of their financial incompetence. Despite this, I still liked the Mac OS platform, so I investigated the Mac Clones which were much more technically sound. I bought a Power Computing PowerCenter 150 MHz PowerPC 604 with 48 MB RAM, 2 gig HD. So far, this has been an ideal computer and I see it being usable for at least another couple years. (and perhaps even longer, now that I&rsquo;ve installed Linux on it!)</p>

<p>I spent most of 1999 travelling around the country (see my <a href="work.phtml">Work</a> page), so I decided I needed a laptop&hellip;ok, ok&hellip; I <b>wanted</b> a laptop. So, I donated my PowerCenter to my roommate, <a href="imagetable/gerry2.phtml">Gerry</a>, and bought a used PowerBook on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>. It&rsquo;s a Wallstreet 2 - 266 MHz PowerPC  G3, 192 MB, 4 gig HD, and a DVD. I bought this in July 1999 and it was everything I could have imagined. I&rsquo;ve extracted all my CD&rsquo;s into MP3 format and I bought Virtual Game Station, so I could play Playstation games. This computer is now a complete entertainment system - and it only weighs 8 lbs! Now that I have 192 megabytes of RAM, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that our original ZX80 had only 1 kilobyte of RAM! And even my Classic II had a only a 80 megabyte hard drive! That&rsquo;s less than half the amount of <b>RAM</b> I have now&hellip; The way things are going, this computer should last at least a few weeks!</p>

<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s been a while since I updated this page. Around the time I wrote that
last paragraph, I was beginning to get interested in Linux, so I bought
a cheap AMD-K6 processor and put together a little Linux playground. After trying out a few other distros, I finally installed to run
<a href="http://debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> and it&rsquo;s provided me a
wide-open window into the world of <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software</a>
(I&rsquo;m <a href="http://member.fsf.org">associate member</a> #1088). I&rsquo;m not
coming back :-). <a href="http://www.fsf.org/register_form?referrer=1088"><img src="/images/fsf-member.png" alt="[FSF Associate Member]" width="88" height="31" /></a></p>

<p>My Wallstreet finally died in the fall of 2002 and I mercilessly sold it
for the value of its parts. I bought an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMac">eMac</a> because it appealed to my
sense of &ldquo;bang for the buck&rdquo;, but I missed the portability of my
laptop. So, I sold the eMac to Sung&rsquo;s parents and bought the <a
href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/stats/powerbook_g4_1.33_12.html">12-inch Powerbook</a> in the Spring of 2003. I miss the beautiful, expansive screen
of the eMac, but I really love this new toy. The most lovable part of the
Mac is the new operating system, <a href="http://apple.com/macosx">OS X</a>. It combines the stability and geekiness of UNIX with the beauty and
don&rsquo;t-make-me-think usability of the Mac.</p>
