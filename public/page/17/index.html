          <p>I had the commute from hell this morning. The 4 train went &ldquo;Out of service&rdquo; at 149th street, so we all got off and crowded onto the other nearly-full 4 train going downtown. They closed the doors for a minute, then opened the doors and said &lsquo;This 4 is out of service&rsquo;. So now there are 2 train-fulls of people trying to get to the 5 train downstairs. It was chaos. I was able to squeeze onto the second 5 train that came by and then we waited there for like 10 minutes. We went 1 stop to 138th street and waited for another 10-20 minutes. We finally got to 125th street. I usually switch to the 6 train at 125th because it goes local to 96th street. The 4 and 5 trains go express to 86th. So, anyway, we get to 125th and I see the 6 train waiting there, so I cross over. Big mistake. The 6 train waited for 5 minutes and then said they would be delayed. They recommended that everyone go outside and get the M101 bus! I waited for a while, just cuz I was too lazy to go up. Thirty seconds after the announcement, they closed the doors and said that the train would be going express to 86th street. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t leave to get the bus. So, I finally get to my destination, an hour later than usual, 10 blocks further downtown from where I wanted to be. I usually don&rsquo;t complain about the subway, but this has happened a lot. Their service in the Bronx is much worse than in it was in Manhattan.</p>

<p><b>the greatest city deserve a better transportation system</b></p>
<p>
This pattern of service from MTA is continually occurring everyday and
it is getting worse. It took me 2 and a half hours from borough hall
to jewel avenue today. Everyone is saying take mass transit, take mass
transit but over and over again a half an hour journey by car is
taking upwards of 2 or more hours and we are traveling on rails
unheeded by traffic c,mon.and it is taking flipping forever.  time is
important and production hours of the entire N.Y workforce is
frustrated and the growth of the city suffers from this
transportation.How hard is it to not spend money on bright lights and
noisy trains which acoustically can be quieter inside and outside, but
that is another topic on the train, but on evaluating the existing
transportation network and just give us the service please. I wish
there was some sort of competition, maybe efficient dollar vans to run
efficiently all over the mta routes and make a size able dent into
their bottomline and i bet the service would improve immediately. This
dumping passengers from 2 trains unto a packed third and telling them
to PLEASE be patient. over and over again and get off the train there
is another one behind. (May Take Awhile)(MTA)needs to know if this
service continues jobs are at risk.we are now more advanced than this
service now. More growth is coming and by the way the 5 should be
express all the time from 180th to 3rd ave in the bronx.  the 2 train
runs local there anyway. Maybe if the neighbourhood was getting
gentrification then the service might get the #5 express at all
times.The double standard service for Manhattan is different from the
Boroughs and it needs to be stopped its unnecessary.

<p>
What is this with MTA (May Take Awhile) telling people to go take a
bus every time or take that other route to travel.we would have in the
first place. If we wanted to take the bus or the other route tell us
before we get on. it is a we dont give a crap about anybody thats your
problem attitude EVERYONE PLEASE LEAVE THE TRAIN.Can someone please
to arrange a petition to fix this broken system we cannot take it
anymore we dont need another increase we need a simply point A to B

<p><b>Agree</b></p>
<p>
Also got a ticket, e 180th st on the five, moving from a packed car to
an empty one. Mta police are suppose to protect not fine every chance
they get, what is there to expect !!! these guys are fresh out of high
school. anyway, the 5 express isn't really an express to me in the
Bronx, an express isn't suppose to stop at Simpson st because of train
traffic. the 2 local, ha . unreliable . heres my thing, metro north is
one of the best performing transportation systems within the mta and
nation. why is that, metro north mainly serves westchester
county. westchester county is ranked as the nations top ten county. so
let lets think about. " ahhh, who cares about the poor to middle class
residents in the outer boroughs. but the rich get reliable
service. today two five expresses to 238th went out of service without
reason, adding an extra 15 minutes to the commute.

<p><b>Queens service sounds better, but not by much</b></p>
<p>
From the Jackson Heights area it's not uncommon to sit on a train with
two or more train loads of people because trains are late, upwards of
an hour late.  Service here is much worse than in Manhattan, too.  And
to add just plain insult, trains running so far out from Manhattan
reach Roosevelt Ave running local-a 25 minute+ journey inside of
Queens alone-due to construction on the express tracks and then run
express like "normal" the rest of the way out.  WTF.  Somehow this is
tricking people at the end of the line into thinking there's some sort
of normal service?  Bullshit.  Alternate trains, do something
different.  Having 4 of the same train pass a stop before a local
train arrives is just a waste of fucking trains.  Everybody who works
for the thing should be fired.  Out of a cannon.  Into the side of an
aircraft carrier.  Head first.

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>It looks like a fish shack, but the service is much more attentive. We had clam chowder and crabcakes as appetizers, then the fish &amp; chips and BLT tuna sandwich as entrees. The tuna was seared just on the edges. It was mixed with bacon, hard-boiled eggs, and avocado on fresh chewy bread. Mala says, &ldquo;Best Tuna Fish sandwich ever,&rdquo; and I can&rsquo;t argue. All of the fried stuff was delicious and not too greasy. It&rsquo;s more expensive than any other place with &ldquo;Shack&rdquo; in the title, but the food is good enough to make it worth it. Great beer list as well.</p>

<p>We honeymooned in California Wine Country. We stayed at the <a href="http://www.winecountryhilton.com/">Hilton in Santa Rosa</a>, about halfway between Napa and Sonoma. In Napa, we visited <a href="http://www.sterlingvineyards.com/">Sterling</a>, <a href="http://www.peju.com/">Peju</a>, <a href="http://www.vsattui.com/">V. Sattui</a> and <a href="http://www.artesawinery.com/">Artesa</a>. I enjoy wine, but not to the point that I can tell the difference between a good wine and a great one. So, I grade vineyards on different criteria. Go to Sterling for the view and the self-guided tour. Go to Peju to see the stained glass and the etched door. Go to V. Sattui for the free wine tasting, the gourmet deli and the picnic area. Go to Artesa because, well, it&rsquo;s a nice stop on the way back to San Francisco.</p>

<p>I had my first-ever massage at the <a href="http://www.goldenhaven.com/">Golden Haven Hot Springs</a> in Calistoga. We also did the couples mud-bath and spa. They say the mud in Calistoga is therapeutic because of the hot springs. It seemed like regular old mud to me.</p>

<p>Our favorite meal was at <a href="http://www.aubergedusoleil.com/html/restaurant.shtml">Auberge du Soleil</a>. We had the tasting menu and every course was spectacular, especially the rib-eye. Get an outdoor table at sunset and you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. Thanks to Sarika for the recommendation. We found another quaint little place in Windsor called <a href="http://www.restaurantmirepoix.com/">Mirepoix</a>. The service was very friendly and the food was great. We were not as impressed with Greystone Restaurant - the Culinary Institute of America&rsquo;s restaurant. It was fine, but not as good as our other meals.</p>

<p>We liked hanging out at the vineyards in Sonoma better than Napa. It just seemed more relaxed and the wine tastings were cheaper. We tasted at <a href="http://www.ferrari-carano.com/">Ferrari Carano</a>, <a href="http://closdubois.com/">Clos du Bois</a> and <a href="http://www.simiwinery.com/">Simi</a>. Don&rsquo;t miss the meticulously manicured gardens at Ferrari Carano.</p>

<p>We had a bread, wine and cheese picnic in the <a href="http://www.russianrivertravel.com/parks-armstrong.htm">Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve</a>. We couldn&rsquo;t resist the draw of the Pacific Ocean, so we drove a couple hours west through some beautiful winding wooded roads. We declined the dip into the ocean because it was a bit chilly.</p>

<p>We drove back to San Francisco, just in time, apparently, for the Ghirardelli Square Chocolate Festival. The crowds were huge. Who knew that <a href="/images/sf-chocolate.jpg">so many people loved chocolate</a>? Sung, Lei, Peter, Jay, Cody, Andy and Nicci celebrated our departure with some great Chinese food. What was the name of that place? The dumplings were amazing!</p>

<p>Our honeymoon was over, but our adventures aren&rsquo;t. Next in the series: Our trip to France! (This blog is getting exciting now, isn&rsquo;t it?)</p>

<p>Life update time. If you&rsquo;re a keen follower of this site, you&rsquo;ll have noticed the little box in the upper left hand corner announcing my <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding">wedding to Mala</a>. We got married a few months back and it was documented in photos by <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17012">friends, family</a> and even <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17010">an official photographer</a>. (Time wasting warning: There are 500 pictures from friends and family, 1200+ proofs from our photographer).</p>

<p>My brother Manoj created a touching slide show which had our guests laughing and Mala and I cringeing. That hasn&rsquo;t made it to the website yet, but negotiations with the concerned parties are in progress (&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Mala, it&rsquo;s not that embarrassing!&rdquo;). We can&rsquo;t thank enough the people who made our wedding day magical. It was, without question, the happiest day of my life.</p>

          <p>A-ha! This <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/list-indent.html">article by Eric Meyer</a> explains why &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;&rsquo;s can appear differently in MSIE and Mozilla browsers. Both indent the list items, but MSIE does so by setting the padding to 2.5 em, while Mozilla does so by setting the margin to 2.5 em. These are on the &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; selectors, not the &lt;li&gt;. So, in order to get consistent display on both browsers, you need to set both padding-left and margin-left to whatever you want.</p>

          <p>The marathon is tomorrow. I can&rsquo;t wait, but I&rsquo;m pretty nervous. I really want to break 5 hours this time. You can track me online at <a href="http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/results/index.php">the NY Marathon site</a>. I&rsquo;ll be runner number 27072.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2005-11-14</strong>:</p>

<p>I finished in 4:28:09 (chip time). I&rsquo;m very happy with my time and the whole experience. Running down 4th avenue in Brooklyn was crowded, but just breathtaking. You could see a river of people for what seemed like miles ahead. I kept it slow through the first 20 miles and had hoped to turn it on at the end, but there was nothing left to turn on. So, I just enjoyed the sights and sounds. Thanks to my vocal supporters at the 18 (Mala, Milla and Ben) and 22 (Dave and Theresa, et. al.) mile marks. You guys kept me going. Here&rsquo;s a couple pics from the <a href="http://brightroom.com">brightroom</a> site.</p>

It actually took me 8 minutes to get to the start line, so my "chip"
time was 4:28:09, which is about 40 minutes faster than my previous
marathons. Good enough that I can retire from the sport, I think :-)

Hey Vin, way to go, not a bad time for an old man like yourself.  When
next year's marathon rolls around you'll be 35, you just might be
ready for retirement :P.  You also took a better picture this year as
opposed to last year's photo.  Again way to go.  Andy

          <p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a clear, concise handbook for Hospitalist Medicine, check out the <a href="http://medicine.ucsf.edu/education/resed/handbook/index.html">UCSF Hospitalist Handbook</a>, available free online. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s up-to-date (the copyright notice states 2002), but it still seems relevant and useful. And I&rsquo;m not just saying that because my cousin Deepu Nair wrote the <a href="http://medicine.ucsf.edu/education/resed/handbook/HospH2002_C1.htm">Night Calls</a> section.</p>

          <p>This seems useful.</p>

<p>You are in a bookshop or a record shop. You find something that interests you. You can&rsquo;t decide whether to buy it now or online later. What you need is a price check and a quick review, perhaps some ideas of something similar that others might recommend. <a href="http://www.amabuddy.com">Amabuddy</a> can help!</p>

<p>What you do is call (617) 712-3574 (There&rsquo;s a 888 number as well, but you&rsquo;ll be using a cell phone anyway). Then just punch in the ISBN# and listen to the Amazon price and reviews on the book you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>

          <p><a href="http://kurup.org/blog/2005/08/01/quarterly-sells">Andy asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Vin, what do you think of SBG (Sinclair Broadcast Group) Its the company that owns Channels 18 and 24(my employer). Andy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took a quick look at SBGI and would probably avoid it. The first place I always look is the market cap. At 700 million, it&rsquo;s a little bigger than the companies I&rsquo;m investing in. The second place I look is the balance sheet and SBGI&rsquo;s scares me. It has a current ratio less than 2 (current assets divided by current liabilities). This means that they don&rsquo;t have much leeway in paying off bills due in the next year in a worst-case scenario. More than half of their assets are intangible assets (goodwill, etc). Basically, these are considered assets in an accounting sense, but aren&rsquo;t tangible. Sometimes intangible assets are very valuable (for example, Coke&rsquo;s brand name), but usually they aren&rsquo;t. They also have a huge amount of debt which, although common in the broadcast industry, makes them riskier. This combination of factors makes their tangible book value negative. That means that if the company goes under for any reason, the chances of stockholders getting anything is unlikely.</p>

<p>Basically, I look for small companies (less than 500 million market cap), with strong balance sheets, priced cheap (P/B less than 1.5) and with improving fundamentals. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that SBGI won&rsquo;t do well. It might, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit into my strategy.</p>
