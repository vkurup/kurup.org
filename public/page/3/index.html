    <a href="https://kurup.org/blog/2012/10/15/emacs-autocomplete-stumbles-on-yasnippet/">Emacs Autocomplete stumbles on yasnippet</a>
  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p><a href="http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/">Autocomplete Mode</a> is an
Emacs mode that tries to guess what word you&rsquo;re typing and provide
auto-completion. Recently, it started failing in simple scenarios.</p>

<p>It can use various &lsquo;sources&rsquo; to try to figure out what you&rsquo;re about to
type. The simplest source is <code>ac-source-dictionary</code> which is a simple
list of words. If you start typing any of those words, it will try to
autocomplete them for you. Normally, you&rsquo;d put those words in a file,
with each word on a separate line, but for testing purposes, you can
also add them manually using an elisp function. Here&rsquo;s the test that
failed for me:</p>

<pre><code>(add-to-list 'ac-user-dictionary &quot;foobar@example.com&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>That adds the email address to the dictionary. Then, typing &lsquo;foo&rsquo; in
any buffer, should offer to autocomplete the entire email address.
Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>To debug, I typed &lsquo;foo&rsquo; and then did <code>M-x auto-complete</code>, which forces
auto-complete to look for a completion. This resulted in an error in
the Minibuffer:</p>

<pre><code>ac-yasnippet-candidates: Symbol's function definition is void: yas/current-snippet-table
</code></pre>

<p>This led me to check which &lsquo;sources&rsquo; autocomplete was trying to use:
<code>C-h v ac-sources</code></p>

<pre><code>(ac-source-features ac-source-functions ac-source-yasnippet
 ac-source-variables ac-source-symbols ac-source-abbrev
 ac-source-dictionary ac-source-words-in-same-mode-buffers)
</code></pre>

<p>So, autocomplete is looking through each one of those sources, trying
to find possible words I might be typing. The third one is called
<code>ac-source-yasnippet</code>, which seems to be where my error is coming
from.</p>

<p>So, I looked into the yasnippet source code and found that, indeed,
there was no function named <code>yas/current-snippet-table</code>. That function
has been renamed to <code>yas--get-snippets-table</code> in version 0.8.0, but
autocomplete is still relying on the old function name. (RANT: Don&rsquo;t
rename functions that others might be using without providing some
kind of alias, at least temporarily) I looked at the code for
<a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete">autosnippet on github</a>
and noted that the latest version has been fixed to use the new code,
but it hasn&rsquo;t yet been released on MELPA. Until it is, the quick
solution is to remove <code>ac-source-yasnippet</code> from <code>ac-sources</code>.</p>

<pre><code>(delq 'ac-source-yasnippet ac-sources)
</code></pre>

<p>Then typing &lsquo;foo&rsquo; autocompletes to &lsquo;foobar@example.com&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It seems that autocomplete should be more forgiving of errors in any
specific &lsquo;source&rsquo;, passing it up to use other sources. Alternatively,
it should fail loudly when there&rsquo;s an error, so that I can know to fix
or remove the offending &lsquo;source&rsquo;.</p>

          <p>I was a huge Apple fan growing up and IBM was Apple&rsquo;s enemy. Buying an
IBM computer would have been unthinkable.</p>

<p>Well, the unthinkable has happened. Of course IBM doesn&rsquo;t make laptops
anymore, but their computers live on under the Lenovo name. I am the
proud owner of a new <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t420s">Lenovo Thinkpad T420S</a>. I
love this computer. It&rsquo;s an ugly black boxy thing, but it&rsquo;s light (4
lbs), quiet and speedy. And the keyboard is just pure awesome. That&rsquo;s
the main reason that I bought the T420S as opposed to the current T430
line. The new line has the chicklet keyboard that is being used on all
laptops these days. The T420 is the last one with the old-fashioned
clicky keyboard, which I love.</p>

<p>I also feel very lucky to get the deal that I got. I bought it from
<a href="http://outlet.lenovo.com">Lenovo&rsquo;s Outlet store</a>, which had about
thirty T420s&rsquo;s in stock when I was shopping. This one was about half
the price of the others, by my estimation. It&rsquo;s so underpriced that
I&rsquo;m wondering if I&rsquo;m missing an obvious flaw, but I don&rsquo;t see it.
(Please let me know if you do!)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a comparison between the specs of my computer compared to one
that was available at the Outlet store on October 4th, 2012:</p>

<p>The RAM is better on the other model, but Windows 7 Professional is an
upgrade on my model. I don&rsquo;t really understand why mine was so cheap,
but I&rsquo;m pretty happy about it!</p>

<p>I added another 4G of RAM, moved Windows to a VirtualBox image and
installed Arch Linux with Xmonad. It takes about 10 seconds to get
from the BIOS screen to a working computer. I&rsquo;ll post some info on my
setup in a future post.</p>

    <a href="https://kurup.org/blog/2012/08/21/thoughts-on-free-will/">Thoughts on Free Will</a>
  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Time for some pop philosophy. I&rsquo;ve never thought too deeply about the
concept of free will. Of course we have free will! I chose to live my
life a certain way. I could choose to live a different way. It is my
free will to choose how I live. I&rsquo;ve never thought about it more
deeply than that.</p>

<p>I recently read Walter Isaacson&rsquo;s biography of Einstein and I was
forced to think more deeply about free will. The biography is
excellent. It gives more depth to Einstein, who, despite his flaws, is
still a heroic figure. One day, I&rsquo;ll do a proper review, but the piece
that struck me the hardest was Einstein&rsquo;s views on free will. He
didn&rsquo;t believe that free will existed, and not only that, he didn&rsquo;t
even to seem to think that this was a controversial position. It
appears that Isaacson didn&rsquo;t either, because he didn&rsquo;t spend much time
on that part of Einstein&rsquo;s character. But, it seemed so strange to me,
since I assumed that we all have free will.</p>

<p>So, I read Sam Harris&rsquo;s e-book
<a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Free Will</a>, in which he concisely
explains why free will is a myth. Take any conscious decision that you
might make. Let&rsquo;s say you choose at this moment to go eat a pizza. Do
you have the free will to make that choice? Well, you certainly can go
eat pizza, but the question is if you had the free will to do it. What
were the steps that led to making that choice. Somewhere in your
brain, a certain set of neurons fired to trigger the idea in your mind
to have a pizza. How did those neurons fire? Either there was a
conscious decision to have that thought, or it was an unconscious
decision that you didn&rsquo;t control. And if it was a conscious decision,
then you can take that back a step further and ask how that decision
occurred. Eventually, you will have to start at some unconscious (or
subconscious) event which triggered the series of events which
eventually led to your decision to have a pizza. No matter how far
back you can track the conscious trail that led to a pizza forming in
your mind, eventually you are left with an unconscious starting point.
Certainly all of these thoughts are heavily influenced by your life
experiences. If you&rsquo;ve never seen or heard of a pizza, there&rsquo;s a zero
percent chance that you&rsquo;ll think of a eating a pizza. But all of those
life experiences are themselves the result of conscious and
unconscious decisions, all of which we ultimately have no specific
control over.</p>

<p>Every thought you have is the only thought you could have at that
moment. It is the result of all of the life experiences and thoughts
that you have had up to that moment. If you consciously try to
&ldquo;create&rdquo; an original thought, just to prove that you have free will,
well&hellip; you can&rsquo;t. Because that decision itself originated from
somewhere in your subconscious, and is therefore something that you
don&rsquo;t have conscious control over.</p>

<p>In addition to this theoretical rationalization against the concept of
free will, Harris describes multiple studies from neuroscience
which show that neurons fire in our subconscious well before we
develop the urge to act. Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/3/623.short">The famous Libet Experiment from 1983</a></li>
<li><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05994.x/full#ss4">Decoding and predicting intentions</a>.
Skip to the the short section titled &lsquo;Implications for the free-will debate?&rsquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627310010822">Internally Generated Preactivation of Single Neurons in Human Medial Frontal Cortex Predicts Volition</a>.
The neuroscience in this article is pretty deep. I only watched the
video abstract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line: I&rsquo;m convinced that I don&rsquo;t have the free will that I
thought I did. The question is how this should affect my life. It
could be depressing. If every thought of mine originates in a way that
I don&rsquo;t control, then am I just being steered through life? It makes
my accomplishments in life seem less &ldquo;worthy&rdquo;. On the other hand, it
can be quite freeing. My path through life is determined. Perhaps I
shouldn&rsquo;t be worrying so much about every decision, because I know
that they&rsquo;re not really &ldquo;my&rdquo; decisions to make. It can also give you
more empathy for others, knowing that they also have no will do
anything but what they are doing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still a confusing topic, because I &ldquo;feel&rdquo; like I have options in
life and I &ldquo;feel&rdquo; like taking different options will change my life.
That part is true. The part that isn&rsquo;t true is that I have any control
over the range of available options, nor over the specific option that
I choose. Even Harris seems to be a little conflicted here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Losing a belief in free will has not made me fatalistic—in fact, it has increased my feelings of freedom. My hopes, fears, and neuroses seem less personal and indelible. There is no telling how much I might change in the future. Just as one wouldn’t draw a lasting conclusion about oneself on the basis of a brief experience of indigestion, one needn’t do so on the basis of how one has thought or behaved for vast stretches of time in the past. A creative change of inputs to the system—learning new skills, forming new relationships, adopting new habits of attention—may radically transform one’s life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is how do you accomplish a &lsquo;creative change of inputs&rsquo;,
if you don&rsquo;t have the will to do so? I guess the idea is that while I
don&rsquo;t have any control over the thoughts that arise in my brain, I do
have perceived control over my decisions. With whatever power my
conscious brain has, I can choose things that will improve my life,
with the hope that exposure to new experiences will &lsquo;change the
inputs&rsquo; to my subconscious brain. Ugh, just thinking about how this
all works makes my brain hurt. I guess this is why I never studied
philosophy before. :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Free Will</a> is short and cheap and
I highly recommend it.</p>

focused on programming issues. They interview interesting programmers,
but they carefully edit the interviews to focus on the parts that are
the most interesting, interspersing them with music and effects. It&rsquo;s
really well done.</p>

          <p>I woke up, got ready and went downstairs. I am not a morning person. I
try to do as little thinking as possible, because thinking eventually
leads to the rational conclusion that I should just go back to bed. I
get to the coffee machine, grab my plastic mug and start pouring.
Suddenly, I&rsquo;m woken from my daze. I hear little footsteps pounding
across the hallway above me. I look towards the bottom of the stairs
and see a little figure race around the corner with a determined,
slightly fearful look in her face. She&rsquo;s afraid that she&rsquo;s too late
and that I&rsquo;ve already left for work. She spies me and I must be
smiling because her face melts into the biggest, happiest smile and
her pace quickens. We run to meet each other in a big hug. &ldquo;Daddy, can
I watch the milk go in your coffee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moments like that are so joyous, and I have underestimated how much
they mean to me. I want to capture them and never let them go.</p>

          <p>Like the rest of the geek world, we&rsquo;ve been excited by Curiosity&rsquo;s
successful trip to Mars. Here&rsquo;s a cool video which combines an
animation of Curiosity&rsquo;s landing mixed with the real reactions of the
astronauts that got it there. (Found on <a href="http://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/28851131280">thekidshouldseethis.com</a>)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315"

<p>I&rsquo;ve been disappointed that real space travel is unlikely to become a
reality during my life. I honestly thought it would when I was a kid.
But watching Curiosity gives me hope that we will be able to continue
exploring our universe. This trip to Mars was much more of an
achievement than the last one. Here&rsquo;s an animation of the last trip
(2003 Mars Exploration). Note that the final landing was achieved by
an air bag dropped roughly from high up in the air. Not much precision
required there.</p>

<p>The Curiosity rover is too large for the airbag approach (See image at
right comparing it to previous rovers), so an alternate system was
devised using a sky crane which gently lowered the rover onto the
Martian surface. Dropping an airbag seems much easier than gently
landing a rover without damage. The real advance in our lifetime is
that our machines are getting more intelligent. And the exciting thing
is that I can actually participate in that type of exploration. I
think I just convinced myself to <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373/CourseRev/apr2012">learn how to program a robotic car!</a></p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m going to start blogging more. I know I&rsquo;ve said that before, so
take it for what it&rsquo;s worth. I think there is value in blogging. I&rsquo;ve
been thinking about my life a lot lately, trying to find what makes me
tick. One of those things that gets me excited is programming. I
started thinking about that and remembered this meme that had passed
around the blog world a few years back. It was a list of questions
related to how you got started programming. I remember it especially
because I remember reading MarkD&rsquo;s version and thinking how similar it
was to my own beginnings. Then, because I love going off on tangents,
I googled for &lsquo;How I got started in programming&rsquo; to read other
responses. Many of the posts I found were on abandoned blogs. And now,
for the &lsquo;causal relationship not supported by data&rsquo; statement. This is
because of Facebook and Twitter. OK, maybe it&rsquo;s just the natural decay
of blogs. But I am concerned about the fact that most people write in
forums that are controlled by other people rather in their own forum.
That was one of the cool promises of the web. A little place of your
own that you controlled. Facebook and Twitter and Google+ are all cool
services, but the more time I spend on them, the less time I spend
here. I&rsquo;m sure other people have written about this with more
eloquence than I could, but the bottom line is that I want to keep
writing. I want to learn more about myself, I want to teach others
what little I know, and I want to learn from others. I&rsquo;ve been
journalling a lot lately and that has been useful, but the act of
hitting &lsquo;publish&rsquo; will make my writing better. That&rsquo;s what this blog
is for and I&rsquo;m going to start using it again.</p>

<p>Maybe one of these days, I&rsquo;ll even put up my own answers to &lsquo;How I Got
Started in Programming&rsquo;, but in the meantime, go read

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I wonder how many of my blog posts are based on stories from <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a>. Probably not
enough. Every time I start to listen to a show, I&rsquo;m certain that I&rsquo;m
not going to be interested and within a minute I&rsquo;m trapped and can&rsquo;t
stop listening. It&rsquo;s that good. A <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/450/so-crazy-it-just-might-work">recent show was about people who people who pursued crazy ideas</a>.
The first story was about a mathematician named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Nelson_Cole">Frank Nelson Cole</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime#History">Marin Mersenne</a> had
claimed in the 17th century that 2<sup>67</sup>-1 was a prime
number. He was prominent enough that the claim was felt to be accepted
wisdom and there was certainly no way to test the claim in the days
before computers. That&rsquo;s a big honking number:
147,573,952,589,676,412,927.</p>

<p>In 1903, Frank Nelson Cole walked into a meeting of mathematicians to
present his talk. The title was boring, something like &ldquo;On the
factoring of large numbers&rdquo;. Without speaking a word, he walked up to
the chalkboard and started to write a large number, followed by
another large number and then started to multiply them together. It
took a while, but by the time he started to get towards the solution,
the crowd of mathematicians understood that he was proving that he had
found two numbers whose product was the famous &ldquo;prime&rdquo; number
2<sup>67</sup>-1. As he came close to finishing, the anticipation
peaked and cheering began. He finished the calculation and sat down,
never speaking a word.</p>

<p>Stories like that give me the chills. Can you imagine how excited he
must have been when he found those 2 roots? I get that sensation every
once in a while when I make a programming breakthrough, solving a
problem which I had been banging my head on for a while. It&rsquo;s nowhere as
profound as what he did, but I think I can understand the exhilaration
he must have felt.</p>

<p>I decided to see what those 2 roots are, using my new favorite
language, Clojure. I&rsquo;m by no means an expert in anything, let alone
programming and especially functional programming, but here&rsquo;s how I
went about it. The REPL is such a fun way to explore things like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I need a range of numbers which I&rsquo;ll then test one-by-one to see if
they divide into 2<sup>67</sup>-1 evenly.</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (def n 18)
#'user/n
user=&gt; (range 2 n)
(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>I need a way to take a square root.  (There&rsquo;s no need to check
numbers higher than the square root of 2<sup>67</sup>-1)</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (Math/sqrt n)
4.242640687119285
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>So the numbers I need to test are:</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (range 2 (inc (int (Math/sqrt n))))
(2 3 4)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>I need to find the remainder of a division (Of note, <code>mod</code> also does
the same thing, but <code>rem</code> is a lot faster)</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (rem 9 2)
1
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Can I find all the lower roots of a number? The <code>#(...)</code> syntax is
syntactic sugar for an anonymous function. The <code>%</code> is a placeholder
for the value which is being iterated over. So the following
function takes each value in the list returned by <code>range</code> and
supplies it to <code>rem</code>. If that <code>rem</code> function is equal to
zero, then the <code>#(...)</code> anonymous function returns true and <code>filter</code>
keeps the value.</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (def n 100)
#'user/n
user=&gt; (filter #(= (rem n %) 0) (range 2 (inc (int (Math/sqrt n)))))
(2 4 5 10)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Now let&rsquo;s map over each of those values, finding the corresponding
higher root for each value. <code>vector</code> creates a vector (think list)
with the first value being the supplied value and the second value
being the other root <code>(/ n %)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (map #(vector % (/ n %)) (filter #(= (rem n %) 0) (range 2 (inc (int (Math/sqrt n))))))
([2 50] [4 25] [5 20] [10 10])
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Based on that experimentation, here&rsquo;s my first stab at the
function:</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (defn roots [n]
         (let [lower-factors (range 2 (inc (int (Math/sqrt n))))
               is-factor? (fn [a] (= (rem n a) 0))]
           (map  #(vector % (/ n %)) (filter is-factor? lower-factors))))
#'user/roots
user=&gt; (roots 294)
([2 147] [3 98] [6 49] [7 42] [14 21])
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Now let&rsquo;s get our big number (2<sup>67</sup>-1)</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (dec (Math/pow 2 67))
1.4757395258967641E20
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Hmmm&hellip; that looks like it might not be a precise value. Oh well,
let&rsquo;s try it:</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (roots (dec (Math/pow 2 67)))
([2 7.378697629483821E19] [3 4.9191317529892135E19] [4
3.6893488147419103E19] [5 2.9514790517935284E19] [6
2.4595658764946067E19] [7 2.108199322709663E19] [8
1.8446744073709552E19] [9 1.6397105843297378E19] [10
1.4757395258967642E19] [11 1.3415813871788765E19] [12
1.2297829382473034E19] [13 1.1351842506898186E19] [14
1.0540996613548315E19] [15 9.838263505978427E18] [16
9.223372036854776E18] [17 8.6808207405692006E18] [18
8.1985529216486892E18] [19 7.7670501362987581E18] [20
7.3786976294838211E18.....
C-c C-c (ABORT, ABORT!!!)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>OK, that didn&rsquo;t work. It clearly found way too many roots, because
2<sup>67</sup>-1 was an approximation. We have to use BigIntegers which have
appropriate precision even with large numbers.</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (def two67minus1 (dec (.pow (BigInteger. &quot;2&quot;) 67)))
#'user/two67minus1
user=&gt; two67minus1
147573952589676412927
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Cool, that looks more precise than our previous value. To see the
difference, check their type.</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (type (dec (Math/pow 2 67)))
java.lang.Double
user=&gt; (type (dec (.pow (BigInteger. &quot;2&quot;) 67)))
java.math.BigInteger
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>OK, Time for the big test:</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (roots two67minus1)
([193707721 761838257287])
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Cool!!! It works! Those are the roots of 2<sup>67</sup>-1. How long did that
take to compute? (We need <code>doall</code> to make the <code>time</code> command wait
for all of the values to be calculated, otherwise it will return
after the first value is calculated. This has something to do with
the laziness of clojure sequences)</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (time (doall (roots two67minus1)))
&quot;Elapsed time: 2.2697318183297E7 msecs&quot;
([193707721 761838257287])
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>6 hours 18 minutes. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a quicker way to do this. I do a
lot of redundant testing. For example, once we know that 2 is not a
factor, we shouldn&rsquo;t check any more even factors. I&rsquo;d be interested in
any advice to make it run faster.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even fathom how you&rsquo;d go about doing this without a
computer. Can you imagine how frustrating it must&rsquo;ve been any time you
had a simple error? Just amazing&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://phonegap.com">Phonegap</a> is a tool that allows you to develop
apps in HTML5 + javascript and makes it easy to deploy them to
multiple mobile platforms, including Android and iOS.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> is a dialect
of the awesome language, <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>, that compiles to
Javascript (after a pass through the <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Google Closure</a> optimizer). Because Clojure,
ClojureScript and Google Closure can be confusing terms, I&rsquo;ll use CLJS
instead of ClojureScript for the remainder of this post.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do: Write a simple CLJS app that runs on my Android
phone using these tools.</p>

<h3 id="get-helloworld-working-with-phonegap">Get HelloWorld working with PhoneGap</h3>

<p>Following <a href="http://phonegap.com/start#android">these instructions</a> will
get the Android SDK, Eclipse plugin and PhoneGap working. If you
already have the Android SDK, you&rsquo;ll be able to skip most of it. I&rsquo;m
most comfortable in Emacs, so I&rsquo;ll be using that instead of
Eclipse. Here is the command-line command for creating your project
(the <code>-t</code> refers to your android target which you can find by doing
<code>android list avds</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$ android create project -n HelloPhoneGap -t 2 -p HelloPhoneGap -k com.phonegap.helloworld -a App
</code></pre>

<p>By the end of these instructions, you should have a copy of an app
called HelloPhoneGap on your phone which, when clicked, shows a
&lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; screen.</p>

<h3 id="setup-cljs">Setup CLJS</h3>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start">simple instructions</a>,
recreated here because they&rsquo;re just so simple.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/clojure/clojurescript.git
$ cd clojurescript
$ ./script/bootstrap
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. The CLJS compiler and REPL are ready to work.</p>

<p>Follow the
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start">instructions</a>
under the heading <em>Using ClojureScript on a Web Page</em> to build a
Javascript file and associated HTML file for testing.</p>

<p>OK, let&rsquo;s make something a little interactive on the phone. I&rsquo;m going
to build a BMI calculator that takes a person&rsquo;s height and weight in
Imperial (i.e. American) units and calculates a Body Mass Index. BMI
is simply weight divided by the square of height, with units of
kg/m<super>2</super>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the CLJS file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">    (<span style="color:#268bd2">ns </span><span style="color:#268bd2">bmi</span>)

      (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/Math.round</span> (<span style="color:#b58900">/ </span><span style="color:#268bd2">w</span> (<span style="color:#b58900">* </span><span style="color:#268bd2">h</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">h</span>))))
    
    (<span style="color:#268bd2">defn </span><span style="color:#719e07">^</span><span style="color:#2aa198">:export</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">alertDismissed</span> []
      <span style="color:#268bd2">nil</span>)
    
    (<span style="color:#268bd2">defn </span><span style="color:#719e07">^</span><span style="color:#2aa198">:export</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">displaybmi</span> [<span style="color:#268bd2">form</span>]
      (<span style="color:#719e07">let </span>[<span style="color:#268bd2">h</span> (<span style="color:#268bd2">height</span> (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/parseInt</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">form.f.value</span>) (<span style="color:#268bd2">js/parseInt</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">form.i.value</span>))

<p>Basically, we create simple functions to convert Imperial heights and
weights to metric values, calculate a BMI and then use <code>displaybmi</code> to
parse form parameters, calculate the BMI and show that result in an
Android notification popup. <code>alertDismissed</code> is a callback that gets
called when the user dismisses the notification. (I&rsquo;m just discarding
the information here). Those are the only 2 functions that are needed
by the HTML file, so those are the only 2 that need the <code>:export</code>
metadata tag. <code>navigator.notification.alert</code> is a PhoneGap API call
that does the actual notification.</p>

<p>The calls prefixed by <code>js/</code> are understood by the CLJS compiler to
refer to the global JavaScript namespace. If you didn&rsquo;t include that
prefix, the compiler would assume you meant a call in the local
<code>bmi</code> namespace, which would obviously fail.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the HTML file (in <code>HelloPhoneGap/assets/www/</code>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="color:#719e07">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</span>

   &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2">body</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2">html</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Now compile the CLJS and move the compiled JS file to
<code>HelloPhoneGap/assets/www/</code></p>

<pre><code>$ ./bin/cljsc bmi.cljs '{:optimizations :simple :pretty-print true}' &gt; bmi.js
$ cp bmi.js ~/dev/HelloPhoneGap/assets/www/
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>:simple</code> value for optimizations and the <code>true</code> value for
pretty-print make it so that we can read the resulting JS file, but
can be changed to <code>:advanced</code> and <code>false</code> respectively when ready for
production.</p>

<p>Now, go back into the HelloPhoneGap Android project and compile it and
send it to the emulator (<code>C-c C-c i</code> in emacs). You should now have a
simple BMI calculator working on Android.</p>

<p>The promise of PhoneGap is that you could use similar HTML/Javascript
to create iOS versions as well, but I haven&rsquo;t done that yet. There are
tons of API calls available on both platforms which are supposed to
give you the same access that native apps have. Using ClojureScript
means you get to use a modern functional language to create your app,
while getting access to the features that only JavaScript APIs
provide.</p>
