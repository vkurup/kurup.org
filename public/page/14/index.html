          <p>Linux Journal featured an <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8986">article about a web application written in OpenACS</a>. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://fungoes.mek.cc/">Fungoes</a> and it tabulates and formats baseball statistics. If I had access to this app when I was a kid, I would&rsquo;ve been in heaven. I remember spending hours and hours memorizing stats from the back of baseball cards. I&rsquo;ve forgotten most of what I memorized, but I can still rattle off HR stats for most of the 1982 Brewers. This site really takes me back.</p>

<p>Fungoes is still in it&rsquo;s early stages, but Mat apparently has big plans for it. It should be fun to watch.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>I built a web application to keep track of my running a couple years
ago. I really began using it in earnest during my training for the New
York Marathon last year. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to make it available for
others to use for a long time, but it always seemed like there was a
little more work I needed to do on it. While working on it the other
day, I noticed the original timestamp on one of the source files:
<strong>September 21, 2003</strong> Yikes! That&rsquo;s 2 and a half years ago. Enough is
enough &mdash; it&rsquo;s time to let this baby free&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://kurup.org/run">Hit The Wall</a> is officially version 0.2 and
available for free use by anyone who wants to keep track of their
running. Feel free to look through <a href="http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=16832">my real log (read-only)</a> or
<a href="http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=63350">demorunner&rsquo;s fake log (read-write)</a> to try it
out.</p>

Cool little tool Vinod, but after reading the reference on the Wall
and how to avoid it I have some alternative names:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't Hit The Wall - A Running Log</li>
<li>Avoiding The Wall - A Runner's Log</li>
<li>Going Through Walls - Running Log</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Good point. I just thought 'Hit The Wall' sounded catchy. And it works
in the same vein as FSF's text pager being named 'less' (rather than
'more'). Get it? :-)
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, it's better than the previous name I had in mind,
which was 'Running Log".

          <p>So, I just talked with one of my best friends and learned that he <strong>still</strong> doesn&rsquo;t read my blog. Devastating! We had an interesting conversation about how the value of &lsquo;The Great Idea&rsquo; can be overrated and I wanted to point him to this <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html">great essay about the same topic by Paul Graham</a>. Let&rsquo;s see how long it takes him to find it.</p>

<p>I enjoy most of <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham&rsquo;s writings</a>. He writes about startups and software, aimed at the high school/college age geek. His writings would have been invaluable when I was in high school. Of course, he was probably in high school at the time. :-)</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>Permalink stands for &lsquo;permanent link&rsquo;. When you create a blog post, it gets added to the top of your blog, pushing older entries down. Eventually, posts get pushed off the front page, so it&rsquo;s important that you have a way to refer to old blog posts. A permalink is the link that will always point to a specific post.</p>

<p>OpenACS (lars-blogger) permalinks look like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry_id=58950
</code></pre>

<p>This works and it&rsquo;s really easy to code, but it doesn&rsquo;t give much information about the content or date of the post.</p>

<p>A lot of other blog packages use permalinks which look like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://kurup.org/blog/2006/03/01/tag-cloud
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to tell how old the post is, and what it might be about. More importantly, it seems that search engines give URLs like this more weight. So, I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and made the changes on my blog. Enjoy!</p>

<p>For the OpenACS geeks, here&rsquo;s <a href="http://kurup.org/acs/blog_permalink">the changes that I made</a>. It won&rsquo;t necessarily apply cleanly against OpenACS, but it will give you an idea of what to change. It includes an automated test to assure you that both the old and new permalinks work.</p>

<p>
You'll end up with ambiguous urls. The util_text_to_url proc can
disambiguate a list of urls for you, and then you'd need to store the
new url in the db.
</p>
<p>
That would also avoid the whole list/loop shenanegins. It would also
be easy to write a little script to go through your existing db and
create the urls for existing blog entries.
</p>
<p>
But that might be considered hard work ;)

<p><b>Excellent point</b></p>

I thought about that briefly while I wrote this, but figured, "What
are the chances that I'd write 2 posts in the same day with the same
title?" In other words, I took the easy way out.
</p>
<p>
But adding the permalink to the DB does sound like the right thing to
do, so I'll work on it or head over to <a
href="http://mark.aufflick.com/blog/2006/05/05/friendly-blog-links">your

It combines a lot of information in 1 page and the adjustable graph at the top of a stock&rsquo;s page is just WAY cool. You can focus in on any period of time and see news &amp; reports from that period. They&rsquo;ve also added blog posts as a news source.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the ideal place to get a quick snapshot of a stock. Lots of information in a very quick-loading page. The major missing item is dividend information. Hopefully it will be there soon.</p>

  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p>It was cold out there today. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, a headband and gloves, and I was still cold. I doubted whether I&rsquo;d be able to break 2 hours, like I&rsquo;d hoped. A mile into the race I was sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it. It felt like I was just running in place. As usual though, I eventually warmed up and felt pretty good.</p>

<p>I planned to take the first 5 miles real easy and I came through in 47:28. Not bad. I wanted to do the next 5 miles in 45 minutes. I came through in 45:41. Not  bad. Finally, I wanted to really pick it up the last 5K (3.1 miles). I came through in 26:43, about 8:30 pace. Again, not bad. The last 3 miles seemed like it was all hills. Even the finish was on a hill! I finally saw the finish line, checked my watch and saw 1:59:13, and promptly took off like a crazy person.</p>

<p>Final tally: 1:59:52!</p>

<p>This is the first time I ran Brooklyn and I really liked it. We started on the boardwalk at Coney Island and ran along the beach for about 3 miles. Then, there was a long straight road stretch for about 5-6 miles and we finally finished with a few loops inside Prospect Park. They just need to flatten out some of those hills&hellip;</p>

<p>Half marathons this year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jan 28: 2:21:30 (10:48 pace) Manhattan</li>
<li>Mar 18: 1:59:52 (9:09 pace) Brooklyn</li>
</ul>

<p>Scheduled:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jul 9: Bronx</li>
<li>Aug 27: New York City</li>
<li>Oct 1: Grete&rsquo;s Gallop</li>
<li>Oct 15: Staten Island</li>
</ul>

Hey, looks like you made substantial headway since Manhattan half,
that's great.  Nice race report.  And don't worry about the hills; the
more you run them, the less high they seem.  (I'm lying of course!)
that's my home training ground, so they seem like predictable friends
to me...
</p>
<p>
see you at Bronx Half I hope.

Lucky you - It must be nice to train in Prospect Park. I love the
Bronx, but I haven't found a dependable course yet. I'm a mile away
from Van Cortlandt park, but it doesn't have any runner-friendly loops
like Prospect Park or Central Park. But it does have hills - I guess I
should work there a bit more, huh?
</p>
<p>
My Manhattan time is misleading because I didn't train at all for
it. I was expecting the Manhattan half to be in August like it was
last year, so I was slacking off in my running :-)
</p>
<p>
How'd you do? See ya at the Bronx!

          <p>The scripting language used in most of <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a> is <a href="http://tcl.tk">Tcl</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t receive a lot of press. When people talk about scripting languages, they mean Perl or Python (and now Ruby). Tcl is not considered in the same category, but it should be. I&rsquo;m not smart enough to explain why, but Salvatore Sanfilippo is and has written a <a href="http://antirez.com/articoli/tclmisunderstood.html">gentle introduction to both the basic and powerful features of Tcl</a>.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m finally getting around to moving my blog into the Web 1.5 world. (2.0 minus javascript). I scrapped the categories system and created a super-simple tags package. So, now I can tag posts and <a href="http://technorati.com">technorati</a> can find them. OpenACS barely lights up on technorati. Compare <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rails">RubyOnRails</a> (20 mentions per day) with <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/openacs">OpenACS</a> (1 mention in the past month!). I know Rails is popular, but is OpenACS completely dead? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
