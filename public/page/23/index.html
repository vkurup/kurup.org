          <p>I ran the <a href="http://marinemarathon.com">Marine Corps Marathon</a> yesterday
and can now confirm that <a href="http://www.badwaterultra.com/training/bane.html">Hitting the Wall</a> is a real
phenomenon. I finished about 5 minutes faster than I did in Chicago
(2000), but I was really hoping to break 4:30. Everything was going
great through the halfway point (2:11:48 - 10:04 mpm) when a few
doubts started to creep into my head. I&rsquo;m only halfway? I gotta do
this again? Somehow I was able to make it through to mile 17 at
2:55:30 (10:19 mpm) before things really fell apart. I remember it
clearly yesterday and it seemed to be an instant replay from
Chicago. I started thinking about how much further I had to go and how
tired I already was. Then I think, well, maybe I need to rest up so I
can finish strong, huh? Maybe I should walk through the next water
break - that won&rsquo;t be such a bad thing, right? And then the next thing
I know, I&rsquo;m walking more than I&rsquo;m running. Once I start walking, I&rsquo;m
done. The key is not to think about how much further you have to go,
but rather to take it one step at a time, but that&rsquo;s obviously easier
said than done. The marathon is not a rational thing - if you think
about it and you let your rational mind make decisions for you, you&rsquo;ll
never accomplish your goal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still quite happy with finishing. I&rsquo;m sore all over, but in that
satisfying kinda way. I was able to take the train home yesterday and
even made it to work today. And unlike 2000, I&rsquo;m motivated to keep
running, although I&rsquo;m going to stay away from marathoning for a
while. My left brain isn&rsquo;t ready for it.</p>

<p><b>Metaphor of life</b></p>
<p>
Hi Vinu,  Congratulations on the race.  I fully agree with everything
you said.  You know what I thought about the Marathon that I ran in
Chicago... it is really a metaphor of life... just like you said
taking things step by step.  I saw an advertisement of the Boston
Marathon I think that went something like this... there is nothing you
can't learn about yourself that you can't learn in 26.2 miles.  I was
really amazed at the diversity of people who were runnng.  There were
people who really looked out of shape running at a significantly
faster pace that I could imagine they could run.  I remember a guy
dressed up in a clown suit passing me up and the two guys that ran
with me most of the way.  One of the guys said "we can't let a clown
pass us" to which the other replied "oh yes we can."  I do agree that
the marathon takes a lot out of you both mentally and physically.  My
knees still ache a bit when I run.  I don't know though, it can
certainly be addictive.  I look forward to seeing you to talk about
our marathon experiences.

          <p>Dilu and Amit raced 26.2 miles in the <a href="http://chicagomarathon.com">Chicago Marathon</a> today and both finished with amazing times. Dilu completed his first marathon in 4:19:18 which is less than 10 minute miles and almost an hour better than my first one. Amit ran the 2000 Chicago Marathon with me and finished in 4:30ish, I think. He ran today in 3:57:32 - breaking that elusive 4 hr barrier. Nice job guys!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m excited for the <a href="http://marinemarathon.com">Marine Corps Marathon</a> - 2 weeks to go. I&rsquo;ll never be able to match Amit and Dilu, but I&rsquo;m going to try to beat my Chicago time of 5:13:30.</p>

I kinda misspoke - you still have to register. But if you weren't

    <a href="https://kurup.org/blog/2003/09/29/why-openacs/">Why OpenACS?</a>
  </h1>
</header>

        
          <p><a href="http://www.veshman.com/mt/index.php">Bhavesh</a> responded to my <a href="http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=9513">seemingly irrational exuberance about OpenACS</a> asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the excitement about OpenACS?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are much better answers to this question, starting with <a href="http://www.acornhosting.com/whyoacs">Why OpenACS?</a>, by my web host <a href="http://www.acornhosting.com/">Cathy Sarisky</a>, but here&rsquo;s my super brief answer.</p>

<p>OpenACS is a toolkit to build online communities, that is, sites which value  users and their contributions. OpenACS provides applications which allow users to create and manage content - applications like forums, photo albums, blogs, calendars, wikis, and file storage areas. Users can obviously create content in these areas, but they can also be given extra privileges to moderate the content or grant privileges to others. So, administrators can delegate the management of the site to those who are most invested in it - the community. Currently, OpenACS&rsquo;s main focus has been at <a href="http://dotlrn.org/">educational  institutions</a> (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html">the University of Heidelberg</a>, and many others) where it&rsquo;s ideally suited for course management. It&rsquo;s currently not polished enough to be used out-of-the-box unless you&rsquo;re comfortable with Linux system adminstration, but <a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=117914">improvements are being made in that area</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://kurup.org/content/site-info">This site is built on OpenACS</a>, but I barely scratch the surface of the features available. I plan to add more stuff soon, but <a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=125253">OpenACS is in the midst of releasing its next version</a>, so I&rsquo;m concentrating my extensive free time in that endeavor. Once OpenACS 5 is out, I&rsquo;ll upgrade this site and then add some of the bells and whistles.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure that OpenACS is the right application if you&rsquo;re just looking to build a personal website. <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> is much more suited to that purpose. OpenACS is useful when you want to allow a <strong>bunch of users</strong> to each have <strong>complete control</strong> over their own personal websites, yet also allow those users to interact with each other, perhaps even aggregating content from multiple users in one place. So, if you wanted to create a service that competed with <a href="http://blogs.com/">TypePad</a>, you could use OpenACS to do that.</p>

<p>OpenACS&rsquo;s main power lies in the fine-grained control that it gives you. Every object and area can be controlled the way you want, so the level of control that users have is up to you. The database API is clean and gives you full access to the database of your choice - Oracle or PostgreSQL. Your hands aren&rsquo;t tied. The templating system is intuitive yet offers a lot of features for more complex, specific cases if needed. A lot of work is currently going into building and improving an automated testing framework. There are plenty of other reasons why I love OpenACS and I&rsquo;ll write about them some more as examples of them come up.</p>

<p>In short, OpenACS is the way for me to get things done on the web.</p>

<p><b>A unified package</b></p>
<p>
What I really like about it is that it has the common data model.  The
same user features, the same content features, are available
everywhere.  Try to glue together a PHP forum and a PHP shopping cart
made by two different groups and you're in for a good deal of work.

I'm also a fan of esoteric technologies.  I like using tools that work
well (Macs, postgresql, aolserver, qmail) rather than the tools
everyone uses, since the popular tools are usually extremely
feature-rich, but ugly as sin on the inside (Windows, Apache,
sendmail)

The consistent user-centered datamodel is key. I think some joker

<p>I installed OpenACS 5.0 on my PowerBook G4. Everyone should read <a href="http://borkware.com/rants/openacs/" title="MarkD's guide">MarkD&rsquo;s guide</a> since it&rsquo;s more comprehensive and explains a lot of the changes

<h4 id="install-aolserver">Install AOLserver</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use AOLserver 4. Previous versions of AOLserver came bundled
with a customized version of TCL, but AOLserver 4 can use the standard TCL
releases, as long as TCL was built with thread support. Mac OS X 10.2 comes
with TCL 8.3.x, but without thread support. Fink currently has TCL 8.4.1,
but also without thread support. So, the right solution is to download TCL
and build it manually. But I had already downloaded Fink&rsquo;s version, so I
just manually edited the .info file that specifies how to build TCL and
added <code>--enable-threads</code>. Of course, when the next version of TCL gets
uploaded to the Fink repository, I&rsquo;ll be screwed, but I&rsquo;m too lazy to
compile TCL again right now.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Configure and Compile AOLserver</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/src/aolserver/aolserver$ ./configure --with-tcl=/sw/lib
/usr/local/src/aolserver/aolserver$ sudo make install
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Install nscache and nsrewrite</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/src/aolserver/nscache$ sudo make install
/usr/local/src/aolserver/nsrewrite$ sudo make install
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>nssha1 doesn&rsquo;t compile without editing nssha1.c. Comment out the
following 2 lines (lines 139-140):</p>

<pre><code>// typedef unsigned int u_int32_t;
// typedef unsigned char u_int8_t;
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Compile nssha1</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/src/aolserver/nssha1$ sudo make install
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>nspostgres doesn&rsquo;t link outta the box. Add <code>-lnsdb</code> to the
MODLIBS var in the Makefile:</p>

<pre><code>MODLIBS   = -L$(PGLIB) -lpq &lt;b&gt;-lnsdb&lt;/b&gt;
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Compile nspostgres</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/src/aolserver/nspostgres$ sudo make install POSTGRES=/usr/local/pgsql ACS=1 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="install-tdom-0-78">Install tDom 0.78</h4>

<ol>
<li>Edit <code>/usr/local/src/tDOM-0.7.8/unix/CONFIG</code></li>

<li><p>Uncomment the instructions meant for AOLserver 4, but edit it to look
like this:</p>

<pre><code>../configure --enable-threads --disable-tdomalloc \
  --prefix=/usr/local/aolserver --with-tcl=/sw/lib
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>OpenACS 5 will notice that you&rsquo;re using AOLserver 4 and will
automatically call &lsquo;package require tdom&rsquo;. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to do
anything special to get tDOM working with OpenACS 5.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="get-ready-to-start">Get ready to start</h4>

<ol>
<li>Get OpenACS CVS.</li>

<li><p>Edit config.tcl (a.k.a. nsd.tcl).</p>

<ol>
<li>Change <code>server</code> to <code>openacs</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>serverroot</code> to wherever you put your OpenACS CVS</li>
<li>The config.tcl file that comes with OpenACS 5 will properly load
nsdb.so (and ignore libtdom.so) if you&rsquo;re using AOLserver 4.</li>

<li><p>Change the <code>stacksize</code> to <code>2048000</code>. If the number you choose is
not divisible by 4096, then you get:</p>

<pre><code>\[15/Sep/2003:19:08:02\]\[1997.2684358124\]\[-main-\] Notice: PostgreSQL loaded.
nsthreads: pthread_attr_setstacksize failed in NsCreateThread: Invalid argument
Abort trap
</code></pre></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>Set some permissions:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 755 /usr/local/aolserver/log
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Start it!</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/local/aolserver/bin/nsd -ft /web/openacs/etc/config.tcl
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

There is a great parody of the nigerian scam spam letter crossed over
with SCO over at <a

I am very annoyed with these "johnny come lately" types who are trying
to claim stake to internet technologies *after* they are already
mature. It's like the company that tried to lay claim to
<em>hyperlinks</em>, even though xerox showed the technology back in
the 60s, or the recent claim by another company that claims it owns
the technology for embedding things like Flash, movies, etc as part of
the web browser. Where were these claims when the technologies were
developing???

<p>I can barely believe it myself, but I ran 20 miles this morning in Central Park. The <a href="http://www.nyrrc.org/race/2003/r0906x00.htm">New York Road Runners Club organized a long run</a> for people training for fall marathons. The longest I had run before was about 17 miles for my Chicago Marathon training, but I remember that &ldquo;run&rdquo; being mostly walking in the second half.</p>

<p>Today went much better. I started with the 10:30 pace group and stayed with them. We ran 4 loops around <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/divisions/training/cpdistances.html">Central Park</a> - the 6 mile loop, the 5 mile upper loop, the 5 mile lower loop and then the 4 mile middle loop. The first 3 loops went smoothly, but I started to die around mile 17 or so. I was able to keep my pace around 10:40 for the last 4 miles, but it seemed much slower. Of course, doing anything more strenuous than thinking is painful right now, but it&rsquo;s a good pain.</p>

<p>The pic to the right is from the Run to Liberty 10K that I ran last week. I ran it as a training run and finished in 1:00:46.</p>
