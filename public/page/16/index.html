          <p>As <a href="/blog/2005/02/04/investment-performance-1996-2004">promised last year</a>, here&rsquo;s my
2005 Investment Performance update. My 403b account (VFINX, VWNDX,
VEXPX and VTRIX) was up 6.7% and my individual stock investments were
up 22.0% as compared to the stock market (VFINX) being up 4.7%. That
makes 4 years in a row that my overall investments have beat the index
and 2 years in a row that my stock picks have. It&rsquo;s that second
comparison that is most important to me - my individual stock picks
versus the index. I have little control over our 403b accounts, being
limited only to mutual funds, so I have much less confidence that I&rsquo;ll
be able to consistently outperform there.</p>

<table class="spreadsheet"> <thead> <tr> <th>Date</th>  <th>Me</th> <th>VFINX</th> </tr> </thead> <tfoot> <tr> <td>1996-2005</td> <td>  5.7%</td> <td>  5.9%</td> </tr> </tfoot> <tbody> <tr class="odd"> <td>1996</td> <td> 22.7%</td> <td> 35.7%</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td>1997</td> <td> 15.3%</td> <td> 28.6%</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td>1998</td> <td> 15.1%</td> <td> 24.9%</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td>1999</td> <td> 66.0%</td> <td> 26.1%</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td>2000</td> <td>-25.8%</td> <td> -7.4%</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td>2001</td> <td>-33.1%</td> <td>-12.3%</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td>2002</td> <td>-21.1%</td> <td>-22.1%</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td>2003</td> <td> 31.7%</td> <td> 30.1%</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td><a href="http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=17065">2004</a></td> <td> 13.5%</td> <td> 11.7%</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td>2005</td> <td> 13.2%</td> <td>  4.7%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

<p>Notes: These are calculated using the XIRR function in
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>. The <a href="http://www.gummy-stuff.org/misc-stuff.htm#XIRR">XIRR function</a> takes a
series of cash flows in or out of an account and returns the internal
rate of return for that account. It&rsquo;s the best way to compare
portfolio returns when investments or withdrawals are made on an
irregular basis. The VFINX column shows how I would have done if I had
simply invested all my money into
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vfinx">VFINX</a>, a low-cost mutual fund
which tracks the S&amp;P 500. This number will not match numbers you
see posted for VFINX for a given year because it depends on the timing
of <strong>my</strong> investments. Note that I include the cost of commissions in
my performance, but not in VFINX&rsquo;s.</p>

          <p>Oh, in my last post, I forgot to mention one other cause we supported - <a href="http://nybg.org">The New York Botanical Gardens</a>. I don&rsquo;t really think of it as charity, since we definitely get our money&rsquo;s worth of enjoyment out of the park. In addition, the gardens gave their members a gift this year - the Phillips Senseo Coffee Maker. This is one of those Pod coffee makers. You stick in a coffee-pod and the machine shoots boiling water through the pod and into your coffee mug. It makes 1 cup at a time, but it takes only 30 seconds, so making coffee for a group is just a matter of lining up a bunch of cups and changing the pod each time. Cleanup is easy and the coffee is suprisingly good.</p>

<p>But, the pods are a little expensive - it comes to about 30-40 cents per cup. And, while the coffee is good, I sure miss my <a href="http://www.themudtruck.com/">MUD</a>. Well, good news. <a href="http://www.ineedcoffee.com/04/coffeepods/">You can make your own coffee pods!</a>. Once I find the right tools (vitamin jars?), I&rsquo;m going to try this, despite this ominous warning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be careful not to use too big of filter or to make sloppy folds. If you plug up your machine the pressure build up will either <strong>spray hot water all over the place</strong> or will engage the safety locks which prevent the lid from being re-opened.</p>

          <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again - time to reduce my tax bill! Here are the charities that we&rsquo;re donating to this year. I think they&rsquo;re all great causes, so I encourage you to check them out.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eff.org/about/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> - The internet is the most innovative force in our lives and the EFF working to preserve freedom on the net.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> - When <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">software is free</a>, it means that we don&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel over and over again. That allows developers to focus on more and more interesting problems.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a> - Too many tragedies this year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ashanet.org/index.php?page=about-asha-mission">Asha for Education</a> - A secular group bringing education to the most needy in India</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wfm.org/index.php/pages/1">World Federalist Movement</a> - Supporting the idea of a global community, where countries interact through law and cooperation, not through force.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gfusa.org/about_us/microfinance/">Grameen Foundation</a> - Helping the world&rsquo;s poorest escape poverty through self-sufficiency</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/">WNYC</a> - To support my NPR Podcast habit. I wanted to give directly to <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> since I only listen to podcasts and not to the local radio station, but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way to donate to NPR on their website.</li>
<li>Epilepsy Foundation of South Central Wisconsin, American Cancer Society - donations for friends who were raising money.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can look up most charities on the <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.fourstar.htm">Charity Navigator</a> website to see how efficient and organized they are. Most of the ones above received the highest rating, 4 stars.</p>

          <p>Every year, Google does an analysis of search queries over the past year. They call it the <a href="http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist2005.html">Google Zeitgeist</a>.

          <p>I&rsquo;d like to become a better writer. In order to become a better writer, you simply have to write more. Funny how most things are like that. Still, sometimes you want a little more structure. MIT has a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/writing/Resources/Writers/process.html">nice guide to writing</a> that is both simple and useful. Start out by making your document <strong>writer-centric</strong>. Just get the words down on paper. Satisfy only yourself. Then, revise your writing to make it <strong>reader-centric</strong>. Add evidence, details, and explanations that your audience would need. I think this is a useful distinction because I often get bogged down thinking about what others might think when I should just be writing.</p>

          <p>I ran the NYRR Hot Chocolate 15K (9.3 miles) this morning. It was cold, but then again, it&rsquo;s the middle of December, so whaddya expect? I&rsquo;ve only run twice since the marathon, so I took it nice and easy. I planned to run about 10 minute miles, but I felt good around mile 5, so I sped up. I finished in 1:25:22 (9:10 per mile).</p>

<p>Oh yeah&hellip; and the Hot Chocolate was awesome!</p>

          <p>DUCK lost money both in its most recent quarter and over the past 12 months, so I sold it. I wish I&rsquo;d been smarter about the way I sold it. I hadn&rsquo;t decided which new stocks to buy yet, so instead of just selling DUCK and sitting in cash, I thought I&rsquo;d using a trailing-stop order. With a regular stop, you tell your broker to sell the stock once the price drops below a certain point. If the current price is $23.50 and you set a stop at $23.00, then when the price drops below $23, the broker sends the order to the market and fills it. It&rsquo;s a way to automatically limit your losses (or protect a certain amount of gains) in a stock. A trailing stop works the same way, except that the stop-price moves up whenever the current-price moves up. You set a trailing-stop at 50 cents below market. If the current price is $23.50, your stop is at $23.00. If the current price goes to $24, then your stop moves up with it to $23.50. I figured this would be perfect for my situation. I knew I wanted to sell DUCK. I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to buy next. If DUCK went up in this period of time, I&rsquo;d benefit. If DUCK went down, I&rsquo;d lose very little.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. The stocks that I own are thinly traded - they&rsquo;re small and unknown. You always want to use limit orders for these type of stocks. But all stop-loss orders are really market orders. The broker holds onto them until the price hits the stop and then sends the order to the market as a market-order. So, in my case, DUCK closed at 23.49 on the day before my order. I placed a trailing-stop at 50 cents. DUCK opened at 21.50. The trailing-stop triggered and my order filled at 21.60. The stock price then jumped back to 23.50 and remained there. I got screwed! The real problem is that I got greedy. Instead of hoping for a few extra pennies per share, I should have just set a limit order at $23.00 and forgotten about it. Live and learn. Either I want a stock in my portfolio or I don&rsquo;t. Squeezing extra pennies out of it is not the way to get rich.</p>

          <p>I had the commute from hell this morning. The 4 train went &ldquo;Out of service&rdquo; at 149th street, so we all got off and crowded onto the other nearly-full 4 train going downtown. They closed the doors for a minute, then opened the doors and said &lsquo;This 4 is out of service&rsquo;. So now there are 2 train-fulls of people trying to get to the 5 train downstairs. It was chaos. I was able to squeeze onto the second 5 train that came by and then we waited there for like 10 minutes. We went 1 stop to 138th street and waited for another 10-20 minutes. We finally got to 125th street. I usually switch to the 6 train at 125th because it goes local to 96th street. The 4 and 5 trains go express to 86th. So, anyway, we get to 125th and I see the 6 train waiting there, so I cross over. Big mistake. The 6 train waited for 5 minutes and then said they would be delayed. They recommended that everyone go outside and get the M101 bus! I waited for a while, just cuz I was too lazy to go up. Thirty seconds after the announcement, they closed the doors and said that the train would be going express to 86th street. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t leave to get the bus. So, I finally get to my destination, an hour later than usual, 10 blocks further downtown from where I wanted to be. I usually don&rsquo;t complain about the subway, but this has happened a lot. Their service in the Bronx is much worse than in it was in Manhattan.</p>

<p><b>the greatest city deserve a better transportation system</b></p>
<p>
This pattern of service from MTA is continually occurring everyday and
it is getting worse. It took me 2 and a half hours from borough hall
to jewel avenue today. Everyone is saying take mass transit, take mass
transit but over and over again a half an hour journey by car is
taking upwards of 2 or more hours and we are traveling on rails
unheeded by traffic c,mon.and it is taking flipping forever.  time is
important and production hours of the entire N.Y workforce is
frustrated and the growth of the city suffers from this
transportation.How hard is it to not spend money on bright lights and
noisy trains which acoustically can be quieter inside and outside, but
that is another topic on the train, but on evaluating the existing
transportation network and just give us the service please. I wish
there was some sort of competition, maybe efficient dollar vans to run
efficiently all over the mta routes and make a size able dent into
their bottomline and i bet the service would improve immediately. This
dumping passengers from 2 trains unto a packed third and telling them
to PLEASE be patient. over and over again and get off the train there
is another one behind. (May Take Awhile)(MTA)needs to know if this
service continues jobs are at risk.we are now more advanced than this
service now. More growth is coming and by the way the 5 should be
express all the time from 180th to 3rd ave in the bronx.  the 2 train
runs local there anyway. Maybe if the neighbourhood was getting
gentrification then the service might get the #5 express at all
times.The double standard service for Manhattan is different from the
Boroughs and it needs to be stopped its unnecessary.

<p><b>Need an Efficient Point A to B service</b></p>
<p>
What is this with MTA (May Take Awhile) telling people to go take a
bus every time or take that other route to travel.we would have in the
first place. If we wanted to take the bus or the other route tell us
before we get on. it is a we dont give a crap about anybody thats your
problem attitude EVERYONE PLEASE LEAVE THE TRAIN.Can someone please
to arrange a petition to fix this broken system we cannot take it
anymore we dont need another increase we need a simply point A to B
better service.

<p><b>Agree</b></p>

Also got a ticket, e 180th st on the five, moving from a packed car to
an empty one. Mta police are suppose to protect not fine every chance
they get, what is there to expect !!! these guys are fresh out of high
school. anyway, the 5 express isn't really an express to me in the
Bronx, an express isn't suppose to stop at Simpson st because of train
traffic. the 2 local, ha . unreliable . heres my thing, metro north is
one of the best performing transportation systems within the mta and
nation. why is that, metro north mainly serves westchester
county. westchester county is ranked as the nations top ten county. so
let lets think about. " ahhh, who cares about the poor to middle class
residents in the outer boroughs. but the rich get reliable
service. today two five expresses to 238th went out of service without
reason, adding an extra 15 minutes to the commute.

<p><b>Queens service sounds better, but not by much</b></p>
<p>
From the Jackson Heights area it's not uncommon to sit on a train with
two or more train loads of people because trains are late, upwards of
an hour late.  Service here is much worse than in Manhattan, too.  And
to add just plain insult, trains running so far out from Manhattan
reach Roosevelt Ave running local-a 25 minute+ journey inside of
Queens alone-due to construction on the express tracks and then run
express like "normal" the rest of the way out.  WTF.  Somehow this is
tricking people at the end of the line into thinking there's some sort
of normal service?  Bullshit.  Alternate trains, do something
different.  Having 4 of the same train pass a stop before a local
train arrives is just a waste of fucking trains.  Everybody who works
for the thing should be fired.  Out of a cannon.  Into the side of an
aircraft carrier.  Head first.
