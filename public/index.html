  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/2zE10T1">Nest E thermostats</a> because Duke Energy was having a sale around
Black Friday. I didn&#8217;t have any strong motivation to have a Nest. The idea of a smart home is cool,
but most &#8216;smart&#8217; things nowadays have ended up being more work than benefit. Anyway, for $75 each, I
thought it was worth a try. We have 2 thermostats so I decided to install the upstairs thermostat
first. The process started off smooth and easy. I like that they provide a back plate, which I
didn&#8217;t even notice until my trusty assistant, Kavi, pointed it out. My existing Honeywell thermostat
is rectangular and if I just put the small circular Nest in its place, there would be a big chunk of
unpainted real estate on the wall. Having the back plate prevented this from being a &#8216;replace
thermostat, and learn how to patch and paint the wall&#8217; project. The online <a href="https://nest.com/support/article/How-to-tell-if-your-heating-and-cooling-system-will-work-with-the-Nest-Thermostat#works/?mode=guide">Nest compatibility
checker</a>
and the paper instruction manual (which includes stickers to label the existing wires) are also nice
touches. That all gave me the (misguided?) confidence that even I could do this. A study confidence
which lasted until I flipped the circuit breaker back on and &#8230;. nothing happened. According to the
manual, the Nest was supposed to turn on, say Hi, and then walk me through the set up process. But
it remained dead as a doorknob. I pulled it off the wall and plugged it in via USB (a nice
troubleshooting feauture). It turned on and then when I placed it back on the wall, it complained
that it was not getting enough power from the R wire. The error code was E195. When I looked at the
&#8216;Technical Info&#8217;, it reported that the R wire was only providing 2-3 volts, while it needed 24. I
chatted up Nest support, which took about 30 minutes to connect on a Friday night. The
representative was responsive and useful. They eventually recommended trying to disconnect the C
(common) wire. For a reason I still can&#8217;t explain, this brought the voltage on the R wire from 2-3
volts up to 35 volts, and my Nest was working.</p>

<p>Having tasted the sweet nectar of success, I then tried to swap my second Nest in for my downstairs
thermostat. I made a huge mistake here. It had been easy to identify the circuit breaker for my
upstairs furnance because it was labelled, &#8220;Up Furnace&#8221;. But there was nothing labelling the
downstairs furnace. I switched off the circuit breaker that I thought was responsible for the
downstairs HVAC, but in hindsight, I think I got the wrong one (and since it was warm out and the
heater wasn&#8217;t running, I didn&#8217;t notice because nothing was running in the first place). Anyway, I
walked through the rest of the instructions and again got to the point where the Nest was supposed
to power on, but it didn&#8217;t. So I powered it on via USB and placed it back on the wall.
Unfortunately, this time I was getting only 0.01 volts from the R line. Still, I was hoping that the
&#8216;disconnect the C wire&#8217; trick would work again. Unfortunately, disconnecting the C wire did nothing.
I walked through things with Customer Service chat. Again, they were helpful (rather than just
spouting cookbook-type basic info), but in the end, they didn&#8217;t have a recommendation that would fix
things. They suggested that I get a voltmeter and test the voltage output at the various wires. I do
not have a voltmeter and felt that I was getting in over my head, so instead I put in some calls to
HVAC service companies, but since it was the weekend and this wasn&#8217;t urgent, I was resigned to
having no heat over the weekend. I watched a few Youtube videos of HVAC repairs, some of which were
quite entertaining. Eventually, I tried to reconnect my old Honeywell thermostat and was surprised
and intrigued when this ALSO failed. It made me think that I messed something up somehow. The only
thing I could think of was that since I hit the wrong circuit breaker, there was live current in the
wires. While moving them from the Honeywell to the Nest, perhaps I touched 2 wires together causing
the system to short circuit. I don&#8217;t remember noticing a spark or anything, but that was my best
guess. I eventually watched enough videos to give myself confidence that I could open up the HVAC
and find the electrical panel. I did that successfully (after turning off the CORRECT circuit
breaker, and also pulling out the pull out switch next to the furnace). After cleaning out a ton of
cobwebs, I found the LED light on the electrical panel was off (even after connecting the circuits
temporarily). I searched the panel and found a 3-amp E fuse (like the kind I&#8217;ve seen in automobile
fuseboxes). I pulled it out and sure enough, it was blown. It looked like the &#8216;bad fuse&#8217; in this
<a href="https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/how-to-check-fuses-by-rocco-lovetere">photo</a>. Off to Home
Depot, I purchased 2 replacements for 3 dollars, and then replaced the busted fuse with the new one.
I flipped the circuit breaker and put the pull-in switch back in. The first encouraging sign was
that the red LED light on the electrical panel turned on. I went inside and, joy of joys, the Nest
was booting up and showed 35V via the R wire. So, I guess the bottom line is that I need to be more
careful when I&#8217;m at the circuit breaker box.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Guess what, we&#8217;re composting now! I told you was <a href="/blog/2018/09/22/starting-a-garden">going to be a
gardener</a>, so now you know I&#8217;m serious. For oh so many years,
every Friday, we&#8217;d haul the garbage and recycling out and I&#8217;d think to myself, &#8220;Wow, we&#8217;d have like no
garbage at all if we were composting.&#8221; It&#8217;s only taken a few years of thinking that, week in and
week out, to get me to try. Actually, that&#8217;s not even true. It was still way down on my future to-do
list until I got a cheap copy of <a href="https://amzn.to/2xyqbWb">&#8220;The Complete Idiot&#8217;s Guide to
Composting&#8221;</a>. Thank you, <a href="https://www.bookbub.com/welcome">BookBub</a>! (As if
I needed any other incentive to buy and read more books). But honestly, the book was excellent in
that it made me think that yes, even I could compost. So shortly after finishing it, I headed down
to the Orange County Solid Waste Center and purchased an <a href="https://www.earthmachine.com/contact.php">Earth Machine compost
bin</a> for fifty bucks, and made the kids set it up near the
screen porch. We&#8217;ve been throwing all our copious kitchen scraps for the past 2 weeks. So far, all
that has happened is that a bunch of fruit flies think we&#8217;re awesome neighbors and seem to have
moved in for the long haul. But I&#8217;m hoping that some composting starts happening soon. It&#8217;s supposed
to be easy as pie, but I&#8217;m secretly worried that I&#8217;m missing something, oh, like maybe skills or
talent. But our garbage bin sure is lighter!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to be a gardener. Yup, just decided. Well, re-decided, I guess, since we already have a
garden. It&#8217;s a strip of dirt on the side of our house and we&#8217;ve been trying to grow vegetables the
past couple years. But it has some problems. It&#8217;s way out of the way, so it&#8217;s a pain to check on it
(since I&#8217;m lazy). The ground just underneath the topsoil is hard clay. It&#8217;s shaded most of the day
either by our house, or by the beautiful forest surrounding our house. And I haven&#8217;t figured out a
way to keep the deer from eating the few vegetables that we are able to grow in there. And even
despite all those problems we&#8217;ve been able to grow some zucchini, okra, tomatoes and basil, which
has been super exciting, and makes us want more! Here&#8217;s a photo of the harvest that greeted us when
we returned from a week-long trip to visit my parents in Dallas this summer:</p>

<p><img src="/images/august-harvest.jpg" title="August Harvest" ></p>

<p>But, in general, things end up getting eaten by the deer or overrun by weeds, so we&#8217;re trying a new
approach now, based on the book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2NzBVSg">Square Foot Gardening</a>. Kavi and Anika
helped me build this raised bed, which is itself a huge accomplishment given how not-handy I am.</p>

<p><img src="/images/our-little-garden.jpg" title="Our Little Garden" ></p>

<p>This was my first time using a drill since shop class in high school! We&#8217;re going to try using a
<a href="http://vomitingchicken.com/deer-fencing-cheap-and-easy-and-effective/">fishing line fence</a> to keep
the deer away. I&#8217;m not very optimistic about that, but fingers-crossed! We can also see the garden
from our living room, so maybe I can just shoo them away any time they saunter by. The garden is
looking quite pathetic because we bought some seedlings from the Carrboro Farmer&#8217;s Market but then
all our garden plans got sidetracked by Hurricane Florence (which fortunately treated us very
kindly, all things considered). So, the seedlings wilted away in our screen porch before we finally
got a chance to plant them this week. We&#8217;re hoping there&#8217;s still some life left in them. Anyway, our
expectations are low, especially given how late in the summer we&#8217;re starting, but it would be nice
to get one head of lettuce or something to grow. I&#8217;ll be sure to let you know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I briefly mentioned finding the 2012 UCLA lecture series,
&#8221;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93JMjX1XECo&amp;list=PLy3KRgc0HE8B4neta_B8LPM0G9UWy-Cqe">History of Indian Civilization</a>&#8221;,
a <a href="/blog/2018/05/29/renaissance-man">couple days ago</a>. I&#8217;m about halfway through
and have found it thorougly illuminating. I learned a lot about India growing
up, but never in a formal way, so it&#8217;s nice to have someone as skilled as Vinay
Lal connect all the loose threads into a coherent history. One of the things
that surprises me is that aside from the fact that classes are being streamed
over the internet, there is nothing different than the lectures I skipped (I
mean religiously attended!) about 20 years ago. It&#8217;s a large auditorium of
students watching a very charismatic, knowledgeable speaker pacing at the front
of the class, occasionally making mostly-legible markings on a chalkboard. Not
that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that. I learned a lot back in college and I&#8217;m
enjoying these lectures immensely. It just seems strange that so little has
changed in the university clasroom (at least this one from 2012) when so much
has changed in the world at large.</p>

<p>Actually, I find it reassuring that little has changed, at least in some
classes. There was a time when the ability to download the audio of any
university class was absolutely new. For me, that was around 2002 or so. I
listened to CS61A (UC Berkley&#8217;s intro to CS course) and a few other similar
courses back then. The limitations of internet bandwidth and storage made
anything more than audio difficult back then. But now with those barriers
crushed, I was afraid that everything would be &#8220;multimedia&#8221;, and not amenable to
listening while I commute to work. So, it&#8217;s reassuring to find that audio-only
dissemination of knowledge is still a thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, this is a debug session in progress, so don&#8217;t expect a nice solution at the end. We&#8217;re working
on a project that does analysis of some public voter registration data. The DB is hosted on Amazon
RDS and I&#8217;ve been perplexed by how poorly queries are performing there, despite the tables only have
about 10 million rows. Simple queries are taking many minutes, which is orders of magnitude slower
than my laptop.</p>

<p><a href="http://mlavin.org/">Mark</a> suggested running &#8216;VACUUM ANALYZE&#8217;, which I didn&#8217;t think would help
because my understanding was that the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL would be taking care of that
on a regular basis. These queries had been slow for days with no recent inserts or updates, so
certainly autovacuum should have caught up to them by now. But, I tried it anyway and lo and behold:</p>

<p>Woah, that worked! Sure, it took 3+ hours to run ANALYZE, but wow. So, why isn&#8217;t autovacuum
automatically doing this for us. (I mean it has the phrase &#8216;auto&#8217; in its name!!!)</p>

<p>So those 2 large tables haven&#8217;t been ANALYZEd in weeks, despite the fact that we import a 10 million
row CSV once every week. This is the end of my debugging road, for now. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll figure out
what&#8217;s going on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love this
<a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/05/29/wearing-many-hats/">post by Austin Kleon</a>.
As someone who has found very few things that I don&#8217;t find intriguing in some
way, it is nice to know that there are others like me and that maybe there&#8217;s
nothing wrong with that. I love being a doctor and I love being a programmer,
and I love honing both of those crafts.</p>

<p>He also links to a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/education/edlife/renaissance-man.html">2012 New York Times article about a UCLA sophomore</a>
who spends 1 hour each day learning something new, mainly by taking online
courses from other universities or watching how-to videos on YouTube. We live in
a golden age, don&#8217;t we? I mean, sure, people will look back at our period of
history and cringe quite a bit, but the idea that I can search just about any
term, and find information about it on Wikipedia, and probably find a course on
it by an actual college professor&#8230;. it&#8217;s just mind boggling. I&#8217;m lucky as it
is, but I often think about if I was a kid growing up in this era. I&#8217;d be
overwhelmed, sure, but I would totally be taking online courses left and right.</p>

<p>Actually, even if I weren&#8217;t a kid. I just googled the subject of that NYT
article and found his twitter account. His
<a href="https://twitter.com/_TheDancingFox_/status/686341754262429696">most recent post</a>
is from 2016 but links to a YouTube series from UCLA on the history of India. I
am TOTALLY watching that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s play &#8216;Spot the bug&#8217;. We&#8217;re building a simple system that shows photos. Each photo has a
<code>publish_date</code> and we should only show photos that have been published (i.e. their <code>publish_date</code> is
in the past).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>models.py</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PhotoManager</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Manager</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">live</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">as_of</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">as_of</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="n">as_of</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">timezone</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_query_set</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">publish_date__lte</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">as_of</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the view to show those photos:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>views.py</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ShowPhotosView</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ListView</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">queryset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Hero</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">live</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Can you spot the bug? I sure didn&#8217;t&#8230; until the client complained that newly published photos never
showed up on the site. Restarting the server fixed the problem temporarily. The newly published
photos would show up, but then any photos published after the server restart again failed to
display.</p>

<p>The problem is that the <code>ShowPhotosView</code> class is instantiated when the server starts.
<code>ShowPhotosView.queryset</code> gets set to the value returned by <code>Hero.objects.live()</code>. That, in turn, is a
<code>QuerySet</code>, but it&#8217;s a <code>QuerySet</code> with <code>as_of</code> set to <code>timezone.now()</code> <em>WHEN THE SERVER STARTS UP</em>. That
<code>as_of</code> value never gets updated, so newer photos never get captured in the query.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s probably multiple ways to fix this, but an easy one is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>views.py</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ShowPhotosView</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ListView</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_queryset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Hero</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">live</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, instead of the queryset being instantiated at server start-up, it&#8217;s instantiated only when
<code>ShowPhotosView.get_queryset()</code> is called, which is when a request is made.</p>

only git command I use manually nowadays is <code>git clone</code>. I do everything else in magit. Magit has
a <code>magit-blame-mode</code> which shows when each line in a file was changed and by whom.
<code>git-timemachine</code> seems to take that a step further by visiting each revision, one by
one. I can think of a few times where that would have been useful.</li>

<p>Professor Google tells me that this happens when you try to
<a href="https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb/issues/45">run the pygments.rb library in a Python 3 environment</a>.
(pygments.rb is a Ruby wrapper around the Python Pygments library). The fix is to run the code in a
Python2 virtualenv. I guess the last time I updated my blog, Arch still had Python2 as the system
default. No, I don&#8217;t want to check how long ago that was.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>(my_blog)$ bundle exec rake generate</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So now I&#8217;m running a Ruby command in a Ruby environment (rbenv) inside a Python 2 virtualenv. Maybe
it&#8217;s time to switch blog tools again&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s occasionally useful to be able to create a Django model class in your unit test suite. Let&#8217;s
say you&#8217;re building a library which creates an
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#abstract-base-classes">abstract model</a>
which your users will want to subclass. There&#8217;s no need for your library to subclass it, but your
library should still test that you can create a subclass and test out its features. If you create
that model in your <code>models.py</code> file, then Django will think that it is a real part of your library and
load it whenever you (or your users) call <code>syncdb</code>. That&#8217;s bad.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/7835#comment:24">solution</a> is to create it in a <code>tests.py</code>
file within your Django app. If it&#8217;s not in <code>models.py</code>, Django won&#8217;t load it during <code>syncdb</code>.</p>

<p>A problem with this solution is that I rarely use a single <code>tests.py</code> file. Instead we use multiple
test files collected in a tests package. If you try to create a model in <code>tests/test_foo.py</code>, then
this approach fails because Django tries to create the model in an application named <code>tests</code>, but
there is no such app in INSTALLED_APPS. The solution is to set <code>app_label</code> to the name of your app
in an inner Meta class.</p>

<p>Oh, and I almost forgot&#8230; if you use <a href="http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">South</a>,
this might not work, unless you set <code>SOUTH_TESTS_MIGRATE</code> to <code>False</code> in your settings file.</p>

<p>Comments and corrections welcome!</p>
