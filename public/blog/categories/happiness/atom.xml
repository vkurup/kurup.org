    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I woke up, got ready and went downstairs. I am not a morning person. I
try to do as little thinking as possible, because thinking eventually
leads to the rational conclusion that I should just go back to bed. I
get to the coffee machine, grab my plastic mug and start pouring.
Suddenly, I'm woken from my daze. I hear little footsteps pounding
across the hallway above me. I look towards the bottom of the stairs
and see a little figure race around the corner with a determined,
slightly fearful look in her face. She's afraid that she's too late
and that I've already left for work. She spies me and I must be
smiling because her face melts into the biggest, happiest smile and
her pace quickens. We run to meet each other in a big hug. "Daddy, can
I watch the milk go in your coffee?"</p>

<p>Moments like that are so joyous, and I have underestimated how much
they mean to me. I want to capture them and never let them go.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Mala and I started looking for homes, we listed on a yellow notepad
all the things that were important to us. Like most little notes in my
life, it got lost. I found it a few days after we moved into our home and
was pleasantly surprised that we had gotten everything on our list, except
a lake view. Not bad, and there's a lake about a half mile from our
door. One of the things on that list that we "kinda" got was "running
trails nearby". I say "kinda" because there is a trail which is just behind
the back of our property, but I wouldn't call it a running trail. It is a
paved trail which runs behind the houses in our neighborhood and extends
about 1 mile in total length. It is mostly through woods or along the lake,
so it's nice, but it's not a running trail. A running trail is not
paved. More importantly, a running trail goes for miles and miles, so that
you can feel like you are away from (sub)urban life.</p>

<p>So this was one of those things on our "list" that I would say we checked
off, but, not really, you know?</p>

<p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/vkurup/status/4533018776">went for a run</a> recently
and I can now say with certainty that this is my dream house. That paved
running trail which I had been so ambivalent about eventually ends at a
main road. And that's where I thought it ended. On Thursday, I crossed the
road and found a little mowed path which takes you to the local high
school. And then you take a right and WOW! A huge forest with a 10 foot
wide rock and dirt trail opens up in front of you. I started down this
trail, expecting it to end at someone's private property, but it kept going
and going and going. It ran next to a bubbling stream with water clear
enough to see the river's bottom. There were countless little paths snaking
away from the main one. I just kept running and it just got more and more
beautiful. I wish I had brought my camera. It felt like a religious
experience. I couldn't believe that this beautiful, seemingly endless trail
- the type of trail that I would have driven miles to get to in the past -
was in my backyard. I ended up running 11 miles, which is longer than I
have run since moving to North Carolina. I can't wait to run there
again. This is just another example of how I am the luckiest man in the
world. I always wanted to live in a house near trails like this, but didn't
think it was possible, so I settled for a little "running trail". Just my
luck, it turns out to be the trail of my dreams :-)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/wedding-1.jpg" alt="Mala and Vinod" />{: .inset .left height=112 width=150} Life update time. If you're a keen follower of this site, you'll have noticed the little box in the upper left hand corner announcing my <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding">wedding to Mala</a>. We got married a few months back and it was documented in photos by <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17012">friends, family</a> and even <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17010">an official photographer</a>. (Time wasting warning: There are 500 pictures from friends and family, 1200+ proofs from our photographer).</p>

<p>My brother Manoj created a touching slide show which had our guests laughing and Mala and I cringeing. That hasn't made it to the website yet, but negotiations with the concerned parties are in progress ("C'mon Mala, it's not that embarrassing!"). We can't thank enough the people who made our wedding day magical. It was, without question, the happiest day of my life.</p>

Dear Vinod,

That photo of you running behind the Terminator is one of the funniest
things I've ever seen.
