    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since my Dad brought home an Apple IIe back in 1980, I've been a
huge Apple fan. The design of my website back in the mid 90's was a
ripoff of the Mac OS 9 System menu. (I found a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011110214204/http://kurup.com/index.phtml">later version on the
Wayback
Machine</a>. I
had swapped out the Apple icon for the icon of the startup I was
working with at the time.) I loved OS X for a while, especially on my
12" Aluminum powerbook. But over time, I got more and more frustrated
by it. I wanted to be able to configure more. When the hard drive on
that Powerbook died, I decided to move to all linux.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>vkurup: trying to visualize life without a mac</p><footer><strong>February 13th, 2009</strong> <cite><a href='http://twitter.com/#!/vkurup/status/1207289044'>twitter.com/#!/vkurup/status/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I am happy and productive, but I am occasionally jealous of Mac OS X. I set
up a Mac Airbook for my mother-in-law a few months ago and ... can I
just drool for a minute about that computer? But, I was able to set it
up, wipe up my drool, and then return to my Ubuntu machines without
too many pangs of jealousy. For the stuff that I do, Linux works
perfectly.</p>

<p>The one pain point that I've been having over the past few years is
video editing. I take a lot of movies of the kids and I like to do
some very simple editing of them before uploading them to
youtube. This was super easy in
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> back in 2007. I haven't
found a similar experience on Linux. It's reassured me a little to
hear that iMovie has gotten weaker and weaker over the years, so I
didn't feel any need to go back to Mac for this one function.</p>

<p>I had been using <a href="http://www.kinodv.org/">Kino</a>, but the developer
stopped working on it and it had some minor bugs. It doesn't play well
with PulseAudio, the overarching audio system in linux. So I had to
start it with the command <code>padsp kino</code> which allows kino to bypass
PulseAudio. That then makes all other sound on the computer stop until
I quit Kino. And with every OS update, there would be minor changes
that would require me to fiddle with the audio settings
again. Finally, I didn't really understand the Export settings, so my
videos were never as optimized as they could be. There were tabs for
DVD and MPEG output, but there was also one for Other and there were
MPEG options in there too. I was thoroughly confused and was hoping
for something to come along that would be better. Mark Pilgrim
mentioned OpenShot once and I looked at it back then, but I couldn't
figure it out. I tried valiantly for a day and then returned to
hacking on Kino.</p>

<p>Fast forward about a year and after a little more frustration with how
my videos looked on youtube, I gave
<a href="http://www.openshotvideo.com/">OpenShot</a> another try. Version 1.2 is
packaged in Ubuntu 10.10, but 1.3 offered some other nice features,
like exporting directly to Youtube, so I downloaded the
<a href="http://www.openshot.org/ppa/">PPA</a> and installed 1.3.</p>

<p><img src="/images/openshot.png" title="Openshot Main Window" ></p>

<p>What a breath of fresh air! It was so easy to import clips. It was so
easy to place clips on the timeline. It was easy to splice and add
transitions. It was easy to add titles. Most importantly it was easy
to export to HD video format so now the videos look better on Youtube.</p>

<p>I don't use Linux for its video editing capabilities. I use it because
I believe in the idea of free software and because for my purposes,
emacs and a web browser are all that I really need. But I am
pleasantly surprised when I see something like OpenShot evolve and
improve to the point that it solves my problem exactly. I will be
donating some dollars over there.</p>

    <updated>2010-09-16T09:09:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.kurup.org/blog/2010/09/16/rotate-video</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found out how to rotate video today. I often take video with my
Canon SD870, but I mistakenly take it in portrait mode. I don't
realize this until I'm editing the video and then I have to decide if
I want to subject my adoring youtube fans to the torture of having to
turn their heads sideways to see how cute Kavi and Anika are.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRotateAnAVIOrMPEGFileTakenInPortrait.aspx">this
link</a>
which gives the <code>mencoder</code> command to rotate the video. Unfortunately,
it didn't work with the AVI files that my Canon SD870 create. I think
this camera creates slightly corrupt AVI files. I say "slightly"
because they're still viewable, but mplayer always reports the total
time as "0:00", even while the elapsed time marches along
correctly. Well, today, I found a way to fix the AVI files.</p>

<pre><code>mencoder -ovc copy -oac copy input.avi -o output.avi
</code></pre>

<p>This just creates a new AVI, copying the video and audio from the
original. Now, mplayer reports the correct total time. Then, to rotate
the video:</p>

<pre><code>mencoder -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg -vf rotate=1 \
         -oac copy output.avi -o rotated.avi
</code></pre>

<p>And here's your reward for reading along:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use <a href="http://www.kinodv.org/">kino</a> to edit the
<a href="http://youtube.com/vkurup1">videos that we take of the kids</a>. I haven't
found a Linux program which was as nice as iMovie was on the Mac, but kino
is pretty good. It's easy to splice and reconnect video clips together. It
has nice special effects, though my needs are pretty simple. It's able to
export in plenty of formats, possibly too many, for my simple mind. But,
I've figured it out and have a stable process for getting video from camera
to youtube.</p>

<p>I have 3 camcorders - a <a href="http://www.theflip.com/">Flip</a>, my Canon digital
camera, and a Panasonic DVD camcorder. I can just copy the AVI files
directly off the Flip and the Canon's SD card. The Panasonic records all of
the video clips into a single file with a .VRO extension. I found a great
utility called <a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/programs/dvd-vr/">dvd-vr</a>, which
reads that file and splits it into individual AVI files. Once I have a
directory full of AVI files from the various camcorders, I use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> to rename them consistently. I
open up 2 buffers: an editable dired buffer (<code>wdired-change-to-wdired-mode</code>)
of the movies directory, and a shell buffer in that same directory. I run a
macro which takes the first file in the directory, plays it via an mplayer
command in the shell buffer and then renames the file using the
date/timestamp of the file. The macro leaves the cursor in a spot where I
can enter a brief description of the video and then run the macro again to
do the next video. It works pretty well. I then batch convert them to DV
format, which is what Kino accepts. Finally, I launch Kino and edit the
files, add titles, export them to AVI again, and then upload them to
youtube.</p>

<p>I did this today and ran into a problem with kino. The video played at
breakneck speed and there was no audio. Google helped me figure out that
this was a problem between PulseAudio and kino. Kino is no longer actively
developed. The lead developer considers it stable and finished and he's
moved on to other endeavors, which is perfectly understandable. He's
however, taken the time to describe
<a href="http://www.kinodv.org/article/view/173/1/13/">a workaround</a>. He recommends
running <code>padsp kino</code> which routes all audio requests from kino to
pulseaudio. This worked, but the audio had a lot of feedback. I found an
even better
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8367831&amp;postcount=7">workaround on the ubuntu forums</a>. Use
<code>pasuspender kino</code>, which suspends all PulseAudio activity, gives kino
direct access to audio devices, and then resumes PulseAudio once kino has
quit. This worked with perfect audio quality, though of course, audio from
any other program gets muted completely.</p>

<p>I am still on the lookout for a better video editing solution on
Linux. Eventually, I'd like to make DVDs of the hundreds of little clips
that I have. They don't need to be fancy, but I would like to have some
basic menus and they need to work on standard DVD players. I've started
doing a little research on this, so will post once I've tried some things
out.</p>
