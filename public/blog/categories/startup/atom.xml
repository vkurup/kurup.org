    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I just talked with one of my best friends and learned that he <strong>still</strong> doesn't read my blog. Devastating! We had an interesting conversation about how the value of 'The Great Idea' can be overrated and I wanted to point him to this <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html">great essay about the same topic by Paul Graham</a>. Let's see how long it takes him to find it.</p>

<p>I enjoy most of <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham's writings</a>. He writes about startups and software, aimed at the high school/college age geek. His writings would have been invaluable when I was in high school. Of course, he was probably in high school at the time. :-)</p>
