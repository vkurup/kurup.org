    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://badgertronics.com/blog">badgertronics</a>, I was able to upgrade my Powerbook to Panther free-of-charge. I initially did an "Archive and Install" upgrade, as recommended by the upgrade guide at <a href="http://www.tidbits.com/takecontrol/#upgrading">TidBITS</a> (easily worth the measly $5, IMHO). But soon after the install, I noticed that my system seemed a lot slower. I couldn't pinpoint a specific problem, but things just seemed sluggish. I definitely noticed that DNS seemed to be broken. I was moved to act when I noticed that my IMAP client (<a href="http://gopher.quux.org:70/devel/offlineimap">offlineimap</a>) took 15 minutes to sync 48 IMAP Maildirs between my Mac and my server. According to the offlineimap docs, syncing 50 Maildir folders should take around 3 seconds. Hmmm.... that seems a little wrong.</p>

<p>I searched the Internet but was unable to find a specific fix for this problem. A few posters intimated that doing a fresh "Erase and Install" of Mac OS X 10.3 was better than using the "Archive and Install" option. So, this weekend, I backed up my HD using <a href="http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>, erased my HD, and did a fresh install of Mac OS X Panther.</p>

<p>As expected, everything is quick and zippy again. A sync of my IMAP folders takes 15 seconds now, as opposed to 15 <em>minutes</em>. While I'm happy with the result, I wish I could figure out why the "Archive and Install" option resulted in such a poor outcome.</p>
