<p><b>Thanks From Grameen Foundation USA</b></p>
<p>
Just wanted to thank you personally for your generous donation to GFUSA.
</p>
<p>
This is not an "official" thank your for tax purposes -- you will
receive that via post in the next few days.  I happened upon your blog
after googling your name in an effort to reconcile an old MA address
our database listed for your contact.  Thought it would be neat to
send along an extra thanks!
