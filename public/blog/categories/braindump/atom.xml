    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Mala's inspiration, I've been running a lot more over the
past month. Whenever I get into a good running rhythm, my mind starts
to relax and I occasionally get bright ideas (believe it or
not!). While I am running, these always seem Nobel Prize-worthy, but
they seem to lose some of their glitter when the endorphins wear
off. I still believe we could solve all the world's problems if
everyone was a runner.</p>

<p>On a recent run, I was thinking about how Einstein said that compound
interest is the most powerful force in the universe. (<a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/interest.asp">Turns out he
probably didn't say
that</a>, but let's
pretend someone did.) It occurred
to me that really, it's <em>time</em> that is the most powerful
force. Compound interest is a function of time and possibly may be the
most efficient way to turn time into money, but <em>time</em> is what makes
compound interest powerful. Compound interest over the course of 10
days isn't very powerful. Any activity repeated over a long period of
time can be a powerful force, even if each individual activity doesn't
accomplish much.</p>

<p>Spending a few minutes a day over the past few weeks
has made a significant difference in my life. I've started a <strong>Habit</strong>
spreadsheet to track some habits, specifically, brushing my teeth at
night (wanted to start with something easy), writing, pushups,
running and meditation. Each day's activity is miniscule, sometimes to
the point of seeming pointless, but over just a few weeks, I've seen
tangible benefits. I'm writing more and therefore learning more about
myself. Sure, I've also written some really bad stuff, but I know if I
continue these sessions, my life will improve because I will know more
about what I really want out of life. That small amount of time,
compounded over days, weeks and years will make such a huge
difference. The kind of difference where, in a year from now, I'll be
able to describe it better than "such a huge difference".</p>

<p>I am probably in better shape than I've been in since college because
I'm running, doing push-ups and playing more with the kids. I ran 40
miles last week, which I haven't done since my marathon training
days. It felt easy and most importantly it's been giving my mind some
time to relax (and generate blog posts like this!) Finally, I'm
meditating daily and while that has felt like the least useful of the
new habits I'm forming, it is the habit that I think has the most
overall potential to improve my life. Having more control over my
thoughts and my mind will have positive implications for all parts of
my life. My mind has just been very hard to settle down during my
sessions so far. (Any tips for a beginning meditator would be
appreciated!)</p>

<p>I also started working on my website again and I found that I was able
to pick up commands and bits of knowledge that I thought I had
forgotten. Little pieces of web scripting and SQL just seemed to come
back to me even though I haven't actively used them in a couple
years. Since I had put in so much time learning them before, I picked
them up with much less effort now. Same with running. I find it
impossible to run on days that I am working, so I have to wait for my
"stretches off" to run. It used to be really hard to get to a decent
level when I had taken time off, but now I can take a week off and
still run 5 miles without feeling bad. Maybe that's because I <a href="/blog/2009/09/22/running-slow/">run so
slow</a>.</p>

<p>When I think about the huge benefit I've gotten in a few weeks with
such a small amount of daily commitments, I just can't wait to see
what will happen in a few years! Thinking that far in the future used
to seem ridiculous because I always wanted results <strong>now</strong>, but the
older I get, the more I'm willing to wait. Paradoxically, stretching
out my time-frame for results makes it more likely that I will see
results sooner. When I was always trying to make things happen
<strong>now</strong>, I would ignore the little self-improvement things in the name
of efficiency. Now that I take the time to do those things, the
benefits compound with time and I may end up seeing results even on
the things that have nothing directly to do with the habits I'm
performing daily.</p>

<p>I also thought about how I've been trying to simplify my life and I
wonder whether it was worth it. As a general rule, simplifying is a
great idea. Try to drive less, spend less, eat less. Those are all
good things. But I also found that I limited the time that I spent
developing my website. I moved it from <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a>
to a static template solution. There were steps in between, but each
step since leaving OpenACS has been in the name of
simplification. OpenACS (like all active free-software projects) was
changing and I couldn't keep up with it while also being a dad and a
doctor, so I thought it would be better to outsource
(<a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>) or simplify
(<a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>/<a href="http://blogofile.com">Blogofile</a>). While
that seems to make sense, it also means that I've spent less time on
my website and one of the joys of my life became smaller. So, I am
going to take a more active role in improving my website because I
love doing it. I'm not going back to OpenACS, because I do think it
was more complex than I needed. I've reimplemented google analytics
and adsense because watching those numbers gave me some satisfaction.</p>

<p>Final thought for the day. I've gotten so much accomplished over the
past few weeks because I've become more physically and mentally
active. I used fatherhood as an excuse to avoid running and self
improvement. I said I didn't have time for it. That lack of activity
just reflects poorly on everything else in life. I know that's too
dramatic, because life truly has been good for all of us. But, I guess
my lesson to new parents would be to make time for exercise and
self-improvement. It will make you a better parent.</p>

<p>Lessons from this run:</p>

<ol>
<li>Time is the most powerful force in the universe; using it to do
meaningful things is <strong>never</strong> a waste.</li>
<li>Don't simplify things that you enjoy doing!</li>
<li>Take care of yourself first.</li>
</ol>
