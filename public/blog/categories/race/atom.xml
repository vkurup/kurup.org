    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did something yesterday that I haven't done before. I took a ride on the subway from one end all the way to the other end. I took the D train from 205th street in the Bronx to Coney Island/Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn, passing through Manhattan on the way. Left at 6:04 AM and arrived at 7:46 AM, just in time to make it to the start of the Brooklyn Half Marathon. It was a beautiful day to run.</p>

<p>I've only been running for a few weeks since taking a "long" time off,
so I was happy with my 2:00:50 finish.</p>

I had a short stab at getting back into sport after a lengthy break
last month, but it didn't last too long ;)

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was cold out there today. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, a headband and gloves, and I was still cold. I doubted whether I'd be able to break 2 hours, like I'd hoped. A mile into the race I was sure I wouldn't be able to do it. It felt like I was just running in place. As usual though, I eventually warmed up and felt pretty good.</p>

<p>I planned to take the first 5 miles real easy and I came through in 47:28. Not bad. I wanted to do the next 5 miles in 45 minutes. I came through in 45:41. Not  bad. Finally, I wanted to really pick it up the last 5K (3.1 miles). I came through in 26:43, about 8:30 pace. Again, not bad. The last 3 miles seemed like it was all hills. Even the finish was on a hill! I finally saw the finish line, checked my watch and saw 1:59:13, and promptly took off like a crazy person.</p>

<p>Final tally: 1:59:52!</p>

<p>This is the first time I ran Brooklyn and I really liked it. We started on the boardwalk at Coney Island and ran along the beach for about 3 miles. Then, there was a long straight road stretch for about 5-6 miles and we finally finished with a few loops inside Prospect Park. They just need to flatten out some of those hills...</p>

<p>Half marathons this year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jan 28: 2:21:30 (10:48 pace) Manhattan</li>
<li>Mar 18: 1:59:52 (9:09 pace) Brooklyn</li>
</ul>


<p>Scheduled:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jul 9: Bronx</li>
<li>Aug 27: New York City</li>
<li>Oct 1: Grete's Gallop</li>
<li>Oct 15: Staten Island</li>
</ul>

Hey, looks like you made substantial headway since Manhattan half,
that's great.  Nice race report.  And don't worry about the hills; the
more you run them, the less high they seem.  (I'm lying of course!)
that's my home training ground, so they seem like predictable friends
to me...
</p>
<p>
see you at Bronx Half I hope.

<p><b>Thanks</b></p>

Lucky you - It must be nice to train in Prospect Park. I love the
Bronx, but I haven't found a dependable course yet. I'm a mile away
from Van Cortlandt park, but it doesn't have any runner-friendly loops
like Prospect Park or Central Park. But it does have hills - I guess I
should work there a bit more, huh?
</p>
<p>
My Manhattan time is misleading because I didn't train at all for
it. I was expecting the Manhattan half to be in August like it was
last year, so I was slacking off in my running :-)
</p>
<p>
How'd you do? See ya at the Bronx!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran the NYRR Hot Chocolate 15K (9.3 miles) this morning. It was cold, but then again, it's the middle of December, so whaddya expect? I've only run twice since the marathon, so I took it nice and easy. I planned to run about 10 minute miles, but I felt good around mile 5, so I sped up. I finished in 1:25:22 (9:10 per mile).</p>

<p>Oh yeah... and the Hot Chocolate was awesome!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The marathon is tomorrow. I can't wait, but I'm pretty nervous. I really want to break 5 hours this time. You can track me online at <a href="http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/results/index.php">the NY Marathon site</a>. I'll be runner number 27072.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2005-11-14</strong>:</p>

<p>I finished in 4:28:09 (chip time). I'm very happy with my time and the whole experience. Running down 4th avenue in Brooklyn was crowded, but just breathtaking. You could see a river of people for what seemed like miles ahead. I kept it slow through the first 20 miles and had hoped to turn it on at the end, but there was nothing left to turn on. So, I just enjoyed the sights and sounds. Thanks to my vocal supporters at the 18 (Mala, Milla and Ben) and 22 (Dave and Theresa, et. al.) mile marks. You guys kept me going. Here's a couple pics from the <a href="http://brightroom.com">brightroom</a> site.</p>

4:36:41 sounds well under your sub 5 hour goal. Nice work Vinod.

It actually took me 8 minutes to get to the start line, so my "chip"
time was 4:28:09, which is about 40 minutes faster than my previous
marathons. Good enough that I can retire from the sport, I think :-)

Hey Vin, way to go, not a bad time for an old man like yourself.  When
next year's marathon rolls around you'll be 35, you just might be
ready for retirement :P.  You also took a better picture this year as
opposed to last year's photo.  Again way to go.  Andy

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="inset right" src="https://www.kurup.org/images/bronx-half.jpg" height="500" width="333" alt="Finishing the Bronx Half Marathon" /></p>

<p>I ran the <a href="http://web2.nyrrc.org/cgi-bin/start.cgi/aes-programs/results/startup.html?result.id=a50710&amp;amp;result.year=2005">Bronx Half-Marathon</a> on Sunday in 2:07:05. I ran the same race last year in 2:07:02. How's that for consistent?. Of course, I'd rather be consistently <em>fast</em> than consistently <em>slow</em>, but I'm trying to look on the bright side. By the way, I really do enjoy these races more than my pictures would suggest :-)</p>

<p>We started near Lehman College and ran along beautiful tree-lined streets like Sedgwick Avenue and Mosholu Parkway. The course does a few U-turns, so you get to see the leaders coming back. That's always motivating for me. The only annoying stretch is the out and back down the middle of the sun-exposed Grand Concourse. On a bright sunny day, that really drains you.</p>

<p>I hadn't been running consistenly, so I didn't think i'd be setting any records. I'm happy with 2:07. I just need to get in gear and be more consistent with my weekly mileage. I'm following the <a href="http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/training/trainingschedule.php">NYRR Marathon - Casual Marathoner guide</a>. This week I'm supposed to run 24 miles. I've got 15 down so far with a <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/race/2005/r0716x00.php">5 mile race (Dash &amp; Splash)</a> planned on Saturday.</p>
