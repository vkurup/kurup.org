    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let's also get caught up with my investments. I last updated in May 2006 when I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=STS">STS</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JAX">JAX</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EEI">EEI</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KEYN">KEYN</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RSC">RSC</a>.</p>

<p>At my next quarterly evaluation in August 2006, I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DSWL">DSWL</a> at a loss of 16.7% because I had held it for 2 years and it no longer met my criteria for a stock I would want to buy. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SYPR">SYPR</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BSET">BSET</a>.</p>

<p>In November 2006, I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SEMI.PK">SEMI</a> because it reported a negative quarter on top of negative trailing 12 month earnings. I sold it at $3.02, for a 42.8% loss, just a few days before <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SEMI.PK">SEMI</a> announced that it was filing for bankruptcy and dropped to $0.28. Sometimes you get lucky. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SGC">SGC</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IAL">IAL</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FLXS">FLXS</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CULS">CULS</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PRCP">PRCP</a>, and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PARL">PARL</a>.</p>

<p>In February of 2007, I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KEYN">KEYN</a> for a 18.9% gain and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SYPR">SYPR</a> for a 22% loss because both reported a negative quarter on top of 12 month negative earnings. I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SRT">SRT</a> for a 16.2% loss because it was such a small portion of my portfolio and it didn't meet my buy criteria. I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBR">COBR</a> for a 23.9% gain and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PATK">PATK</a> for a 16.7% gain because I'd held both for 2 years, but they no longer met my buy criteria. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AIRT">AIRT</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HDNG">HDNG</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AWX">AWX</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CAV">CAV</a>, and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JCTCF">JCTCF</a>.</p>

<p>In April/May 2007, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IAL">IAL</a> got bought out for a 16.8% gain and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BL">BL</a> got bought out for a 11.0% gain. I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JCS">JCS</a> for a 21.4% gain because they had fallen behind multiple quarters in their filings. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PMRY">PMRY</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=POP">POP</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HOOK">HOOK</a>. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=POP">POP</a> dropped about 40% on the day that I bought it. Sometimes you get unlucky.</p>

<p>Here's how the rest of my portfolio is doing as of May 31st, 2007.</p>

<p><b>Congratulations</b></p>
<p>
Vinod!!! I have no idea how you have time for all of this stuff (plus reading books), but I have two things to say:
</p>
<p>
1. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW BABY! You must be so proud and so
happy. I always knew that sweet Mala, who loves the Gilmore Girls and
Peanut Butter Cup ice cream, is really a warrior on the inside and
could tough out a delivery that would send me to the morphine drip.
</p>
<p>
2. On a side note, I think the large caps are back man! In this world
of private equity money and uber-duber liquidity, go large baby.

    <link href="https://www.kurup.org/blog/2006/02/08/doing-nothing"/>
    <updated>2006-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.kurup.org/blog/2006/02/08/doing-nothing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's time for my quarterly investment update. Every 3 months, I look at my portfolio and sell stocks that I don't like and then buy ones that I do. This quarter, I'm doing <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>

<p>This is one of the hardest things for me to do. I like to trade. Sell a stock here, buy a new one here. It's exciting. Especially when you sell a stock that's been down for a while because then you no longer have to look at that red smirch on your portfolio every day. But while activity is a good thing in almost every other aspect of life, it can hurt you in investing. The undisputable fact is that the more you trade, the more you'll lose on commissions and spreads. What's more disputable, but true in my mind is that investing overactivity makes me do dumb things.</p>

<p>A couple of the stocks that I had sold over the past year have made strong runs since I sold them. AMN has gained 47% and DUCK has gained 20%. I probably shouldn't have sold either of them, if I had followed my strict evaluation process. But I <strong>wanted</strong> to sell them. Each company had its problems, so I found good reasons to sell and justifed them to myself. The problem was that I didn't follow the sell criteria that I had set up before I bought the stocks. I made up new ones just so I could sell the stock. If I had stuck with my initial criteria, I'd still be holding on to those two and enjoying my gains.</p>

<p>I guess my lesson is that you should decide under what conditions you would sell any stock <strong>before you buy it</strong>. Until those conditions appear, hold tight. This is especially true for small undervalued stocks because it can take a long time for the market to come around and properly value them. James Cloonan, over at <a href="http://aaii.com/">The American Association of Individual Investors</a> runs a <a href="http://aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/">Shadow Stock Portfolio</a> on which my portfolio is loosely based. He recommends giving small-cap value stocks at least 2 years to be recognized by the market.</p>

<p>Patience, young grasshopper!</p>

    <link href="https://www.kurup.org/blog/2005/12/01/investments-quarterly-update"/>
    <updated>2005-12-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.kurup.org/blog/2005/12/01/investments-quarterly-update</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DUCK lost money both in its most recent quarter and over the past 12 months, so I sold it. I wish I'd been smarter about the way I sold it. I hadn't decided which new stocks to buy yet, so instead of just selling DUCK and sitting in cash, I thought I'd using a trailing-stop order. With a regular stop, you tell your broker to sell the stock once the price drops below a certain point. If the current price is $23.50 and you set a stop at $23.00, then when the price drops below $23, the broker sends the order to the market and fills it. It's a way to automatically limit your losses (or protect a certain amount of gains) in a stock. A trailing stop works the same way, except that the stop-price moves up whenever the current-price moves up. You set a trailing-stop at 50 cents below market. If the current price is $23.50, your stop is at $23.00. If the current price goes to $24, then your stop moves up with it to $23.50. I figured this would be perfect for my situation. I knew I wanted to sell DUCK. I didn't know what I wanted to buy next. If DUCK went up in this period of time, I'd benefit. If DUCK went down, I'd lose very little.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. The stocks that I own are thinly traded - they're small and unknown. You always want to use limit orders for these type of stocks. But all stop-loss orders are really market orders. The broker holds onto them until the price hits the stop and then sends the order to the market as a market-order. So, in my case, DUCK closed at 23.49 on the day before my order. I placed a trailing-stop at 50 cents. DUCK opened at 21.50. The trailing-stop triggered and my order filled at 21.60. The stock price then jumped back to 23.50 and remained there. I got screwed! The real problem is that I got greedy. Instead of hoping for a few extra pennies per share, I should have just set a limit order at $23.00 and forgotten about it. Live and learn. Either I want a stock in my portfolio or I don't. Squeezing extra pennies out of it is not the way to get rich.</p>

They're a golf clothing company and they bought a hat company specializing in college sports and NASCAR. Doesn't quite fit.

I bought this last year because I noticed that it had a PE ratio &lt; 10, a P/B ratio near 1, and it was paying a dividend. The P/B ratio is now over 3, so it's no longer such a great value. It's benefitted from the great housing market nationwide, but I don't think that can last forever. Again, BMHC may go up from here, but that's OK because I'm only interested in owning stocks that fit into my philosophy - small and cheap. |</td>

They're hiring 2 big-4 accounting firms to help with compliance, in addition to another auditor for their general financial statements.

I think taking Vioxx off the market was the right thing to do, even though I think Vioxx probably has some value in certain uses. Bottom line is that I'm a small cap investor, so no more Merck. |</td>
