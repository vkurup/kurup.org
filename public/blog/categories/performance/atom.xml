    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's my 2006 Investment Performance update. My individual stock picks broke their 4 year winning streak versus the S&amp;P500 and overall (including my 403b), I lagged the market by a couple percentage points. That makes for a pretty lousy year overall. So, is it time to switch tactics? Give in and stick all my money in an index fund? Some would say yes (or more like "YES, you IDIOT!"). I knew when I started this approach that there would be times where I would underperform, even for long periods of time, meaning 1-2 years. But, on the whole, I would come out ahead. Small cheap companies have always outperformed over the long run. I still believe that and will continue with this approach, at least until 2009, at which point I will have a 5 year track record to analyze. In the meantime, I'm not going to cry too much about a 12.8% gain.</p>

<p>Notes: These are calculated using the XIRR function in
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>. The <a href="http://www.gummy-stuff.org/misc-stuff.htm#XIRR">XIRR
function</a> takes a
series of cash flows in or out of an account and returns the internal
rate of return for that account. It's the best way to compare
portfolio returns when investments or withdrawals are made on an
irregular basis. The VFINX column shows how I would have done if I had
simply invested all my money into
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vfinx">VFINX</a>, a low-cost mutual fund
which tracks the S&amp;P 500. This number will not match numbers you
see posted for VFINX for a given year because it depends on the timing
of <strong>my</strong> investments. Note that I include the cost of commissions in
my performance, but not in VFINX's.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="/blog/2005/02/04/investment-performance-1996-2004">promised last
year</a>, here's my
2005 Investment Performance update. My 403b account (VFINX, VWNDX,
VEXPX and VTRIX) was up 6.7% and my individual stock investments were
up 22.0% as compared to the stock market (VFINX) being up 4.7%. That
makes 4 years in a row that my overall investments have beat the index
and 2 years in a row that my stock picks have. It's that second
comparison that is most important to me - my individual stock picks
versus the index. I have little control over our 403b accounts, being
limited only to mutual funds, so I have much less confidence that I'll
be able to consistently outperform there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK, it's well past the end of 2004 and I've finally calculated how my investments have done for the year. I've also analyzed my overall investment results since I started investing in 1996.</p>

<p>These are calculated using the XIRR function in <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>.

<p>A little background. The years 1996-1998 reflect my 403-b investments during residency - half in Fidelity Growth Company and half in Fidelity Contrafund. In 1998, I started to buy individual stocks, but without any underlying strategy. Until 2002, I used a strategy called <a href="http://www.fool.com/workshop/1999/workshop990527.htm">Mechanical Investing</a>, whereby you screen stocks for certain criteria and buy them without further research. Unfortunately, I followed largely momentum based strategies and in 2002, the momentum arrow was pointing decidedly downwards. From 2002-2004, I invested in well-diversified index funds based on the advice in Burton Malkiel's, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393325350/vinodkurupshomep">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a>. I still think this a safe, reasonable strategy for just about everyone.</p>

<p>So why did I change again? In 2004 I read Benjamin Graham's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060555661/vinodkurupshomep">The Intelligent Investor</a> and realized that most of my previous individual stock investing had been decidedly un-Intelligent. I find stock research and investing fun, and I think there are inefficiences in the market, even if it may be mostly efficient, or efficient in the long run. I believe that an individual investor can find these inefficiencies, and over time can significantly outperform the market. So, while I have most of my money parked in index funds, I also have a significant minority invested in individual stocks that fit a value-investing discipline. Let's see how I do over the next 5-10 years. If I'm still enjoying it and beating the market by 2-3% (which so far, I haven't!), then I'll keep doing it. If not, I'll plead surrender to Malkiel et al and dump my money into index funds. Next report 2006...</p>
