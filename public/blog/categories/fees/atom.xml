    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that credit card companies are charging extra fees for foreign
transactions, you need to know where online companies are physically
located. For example, did you know that
<a href="http://abebooks.com">Abebooks</a>, an online aggregator of bookstores,
is based in Canada? We found out when we bought books from them and
found our credit card statement littered with foreign transaction
fees. The ironic thing is that the book actually shipped from the
U.S. (from Amazon.com, in fact). Of course, there's not much Abebooks
can do about this, but you need to calculate the extra costs into the
transaction to see whether you're still getting a good deal.</p>

<p><b>Amazon.com charges credit cards directly</b></p>
<p>
Hi Vinod. I work in the online book industry. If you bought the book
from the Amazon.com website, they  charge credit cards directly,
rather than passing it along to Marketplace/zShops booksellers. The
charges couldn't have been generated by Abebooks, because they never
got your credit card information.
</p>

<p>
Is it possible that (1) you bought the book directly from Abebooks,
rather than Amazon.com, (2) you bought the book from a non-US
Amazon.com site (e.g. Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk), or (3) that the
foreign transaction fees are for something altogether different?

<p><b>Yes, I bought directly from Abebooks</b></p>
<p>
Sorry if I wasn't clear about that. I didn't buy from Amazon.com. As I
said in the post, I bought online on the Abebooks.com website. The
book just happened to come "packaged" in an Amazon cardboard box.

This will be more and more of an issue as Abebooks moves to process
the credit card transactions for all of their booksellers.

<p>
You can be an American buyer purchasing from an American seller and
still pay the 2-3% surcharge solely because ABE is in Canada.
