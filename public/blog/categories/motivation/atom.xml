    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just found this <a href="http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=195">great article on
writing</a> by Sebastian
Marshall. His basic advice boils down to "just do it!", but he makes
some interesting points along the way. I had never heard of the
Equal-Odds rule. Read more details at his blog, but basically, in
order to do great work, you have to do a lot of "not-great" work. No
one just does great work. So, let go and just write. The great stuff
will float to the top.</p>

<p>Commit to doing it every day, no matter what. I don't know how many
times I've heard this, yet I still don't do it. I guess it's like I
tell my smokers who tell me they've tried to quit so many times. Each
quit attempt is preparation for the time that you really quit. You
never know when it's going to stick, so just keep trying.</p>

<p>"<em>I accepted that I'm going to be judged. I don't love it, but I
accepted it.</em>" This is the hardest part for me. My ego is fragile, but
oh well. The benefits are worth the risks.</p>

<p>"<em>Try to think of each visitor as an honored guest.</em>" I like that. My
site gets minimal traffic, but that's not zero. And I actually know
some of the people that read ... don't worry, I won't embarrass them
by naming names. The bottom line is that my whole purpose is to
improve the lives of others, in whatever small way possible. To think
that <strong>anyone</strong> is spending their precious time reading this is an honor
to me.</p>

<p>I may never be the prolific writer that I envision myself being, but
it can't hurt to keep trying.</p>

    <updated>2009-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.kurup.org/blog/2009/09/22/running-slow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been a runner for a long time. I started running in junior high
school, so I could be on the track team. I've had a few long stretches
where I didn't run, but for most of the past 25 years, I've been a runner.</p>

<p>It wasn't until the 2005 New York Marathon though, that I really felt like
a runner. I had already run 2 marathons, but I had walked a lot in both of
them. I ran the entire NYC Marathon from beginning to end. That, to me, was
a <strong>huge</strong> deal. Before 2004, I don't think I would ever have believed that
I could do that. I don't necessarily think that using walk breaks makes you
any less of a runner. But, <strong>for me</strong>, using walk breaks was a crutch. I'd
gotten to the point that running 3, 4 or even 5 miles was easy. I dreaded
anything longer than that. If I was planning a 9 mile run, I would start
doing math in my head around mile 3. "OK, I've done 3 miles, now I just
need to do that again... and then again..." And that's where I would defeat
myself. I mean, I was already tired at mile 3! How was I going to do that
same distance <em>twice</em> more?</p>

<p>Sometime around 2004, that changed. I was working at Metropolitan Hospital,
which is on 96th street and 1st avenue in NYC. I had decided to run the NYC
Marathon in 2005, but I wasn't training enough. After the subway ride home
from work, I would be drained, and going out for a run at 6 or 7 PM was
just too much to even think about. I'm so glad that I had made the decision
to run the marathon. I hadn't even signed up - it was way too early - but
that decision in my brain was firm. I knew that I had to find a way to
train. Running in the morning was an option, but if you know me, then you
know that it wasn't. :-) Ironically, I'm now up before 5AM every day these
days because of my 2 precious little ones. But, back in those bachelor
days, mornings didn't exist.</p>

<p>I decided to make running part of my daily commute. I would take the subway
to work and then run home after work. I was living on 22nd St and 3rd
Avenue, so it was a 5 mile run along the East River. Living in NYC was so
convenient in that way. I never had to worry about leaving a car at work or
figuring out what to do if I couldn't run all the way home. The subway was
always there. I started out by running every couple days, then every other
day, and then, as many days as I could. It was great for training and for
my peace of mind. There's no better way to release the stress of a workday
than a long, easy run. I got much faster during the summer of 2004, and in
September, I ran the Staten Island Half Marathon in 1:41:56, which is much
faster than I ever dreamed was possible at that time.</p>

<p>But getting <em>faster</em> is not the point of this article. Running <em>longer</em> is.</p>

<p>The other thing that happened that summer was that I met and fell in love
with Mala. By the next spring, we had decided to move in together, and we
were both living in her tiny little apartment in the Bronx. At first, this
curbed my running a bit. But, eventually, I came to the same conclusions
that I had made the year before. I <strong>had</strong> to run and the only feasible way
was after work. But, the commute was now 8 miles instead of 5. And instead
of a leisurely jog along the East River, I now had a somewhat exhausting
urban trek through some shady neighborhoods. I never had any real problems,
but I always felt a little fear during parts of my run. Every once in a
while a teenager would see me running and shout something at me, or run
along with me for a few steps. But, it always seemed playful, so I never
felt too threatened. Running with a backpack through the South Bronx
probably made me the craziest thing in the neighborhood, so I didn't need
to worry :-) Anyway, the point is that my run was now longer and subway
stops were fewer and further between. In addition, I had all that fear, so
I felt that I needed to conserve energy in case, you know... I needed to
<strong>sprint!</strong></p>

<p>So, I ended up running a lot <strong>slower</strong>. Even though I was pretty sure I
could make it 8 miles, I started a lot slower and didn't start speeding up
until I was within a mile or two of home. And I don't mean just a little
slower. I would run so slow that I felt people were thinking, "Why doesn't
he just walk?". That was tough for me. As much as I hate to admit it, I do
think about what other people think, and the last thing I want anyone to
think is that I'm a slow runner. But, I purposefully shed those superficial
inhibitions in the name of survival. I would slow WAY down. This eventually
served two purposes. The most important immediate purpose was that it
allowed to me to get home safely each night. The more lasting purpose was
that it gave me the confidence that I can always <em>build up energy</em> by
slowing down. No matter how tired I was, if I slowed down enough, I would
build up energy again. I know it makes sense, but I didn't believe it until
I tried it. And I guess I thought I <em>had</em> tried it before, but the problem
was my ego. I had never let myself really slow enough to the point that it
was valuable. Slowing down was the best thing I ever did as a runner.</p>

<p>So, that's how I was able to run the NYC marathon without stopping in
2005. Now, even when I haven't been training regularly, I know that I can
run 10+ miles on any given day. Just by slowing down. They won't be the
fastest 10 miles I've run, but it's such a great feeling to know that I can
do it. It gives me freedom in my runs, too. I know I can take any hill,
just by slowing down. I can speed up at any point in my run, just by
slowing down before and afterwards.</p>

<p>So, if you've gotten to the point that you can run 3 miles comfortably, but
couldn't dream of running 10 or 20, slow way down. So slow that you feel
like a fraud. See if that doesn't let you run longer. And if that fails,
try running in the Bronx :-)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I've found some old journal entries lying around my hard drive. I'm sure that these were meant to be cleaned up and edited before being spewed on the Internet, but in keeping with my newfound obsession with <a href="/blog/2009/02/04/imperfection">Imperfection</a>, I now present them to you, my dear reader(s). Here is the first one, a review of the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vinodkurupshomep&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060920432">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=vinodkurupshomep&l=as2&o=1&a=0060920432" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></em></p>

<p><strong>Bronx, NY, April 9th, 2007</strong></p>

<p>I finished "Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience" by Mihaly Csikszenthmihalyi on the subway ride into work today. I enjoyed the book. It's about creating optimal experience in your life. "Optimal Experience" is the feeling you get when you're doing something challenging and interesting and time just flows by you without you realizing it.</p>

<p>Our quality of life is directly related to how often we obtain "optimal experience". Things that we normally associate with a high quality of life are not necessarily correlated with subjective happiness. Got money, power, and health? You're just as likely to be unhappy than if you don't have them. So, how can we achieve optimal experience? It's about being in control of your consiciousness. Deciding what things give you challenge, what things interest you ... and then pursue them.</p>

<p>Our natural tendency is to think that we want more leisure time and that more leisure time will make us happier. He debunks this by showing that people are just as happy when they are at work as when at leisure. Often happier. Most lesiure activities simply allow us to veg out instead of encouraging us to actively use our consciousness. They are a way to avoid letting our consciousness focus on the stressors in our life. If we were to let our mind go, without providing it any outside stimulus, the first thing we would focus on is our anxieties. Things that we are worried about. The solution is to <strong>actively</strong> force our consciousness to think about other things, perhaps solutions to those anxieties, or other things that would make us happy. That's hard. It's easier to turn on the TV and let the stimuli flow in, so that our mind is occupied and can't wander off to those dark anxieties. But that only stunts our growth. Learning to be able to face our anxieties and know that we can overcome them (through repeat example) is the way towards a more happy existence.</p>

<p>How does this book affect me? It was written in 1990 and I've seen it referred to often. It makes me want to focus more on meditation and yoga. This is the second book that I've read recently that recommended control of consciousness as an important objective. The other one was <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2274">How to live on 24 hours a day</a>, written at the turn of the century.</p>

<p>I want to structure activites so as to give myself some challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Most importantly</strong>, I want to be able to give my children the easiest path to optimal experience possible. This means giving them unconditional love, constant challenges and the ability to <strong>make and learn from mistakes</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are a few pertinent excerpts from the book:</p>

<blockquote><p>p2. "People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to happy."</p>

<p>p6. "The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy -- or attention -- is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Elements of Enjoyment:
 - A Challenging activity that requires skills
 - The merging of action and awareness</p>

<blockquote><p>When all a person's relevant skills are needed to cope with the
challenges of a situation, that person's attentions is completely
absorbed by the activity. There is no excess psychic energy left over
to process any information but what the activity offers. All the
attention is concentrated on the relevant stimuli. As a result, one of
the most universal and distinctive features of optimal experience
takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing that
they activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being
aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing."
(p. 53)</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>clear goals and feedback</li>
<li>concentration on the task at hand</li>
<li>sense of exercising control in difficult situations</li>
<li>loss of self consciousness</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>p83. "For example, TV watching, the single most often pursued leisure activity in the United States today, leads to the flow condition very rarely. In fact, working people achieve the flow experience -- deep concentration, high and balanced challenges and skills, a sense of control and satisfaction -- about four times as often on their jobs, proportionately, as they do when they are watching television."</p></blockquote>

<p>Promoting optimal experience in teenagers:
1. Clarity - teens know what their parents expect of them
2. Centering - teens perceive that their parents are interested in what they are doing in the present, rather than being preoccupied about the future
3. Choice - teens feel they have a variety of choices, including breaking parental rules as long as they are willing to deal with consequences
4. Commitment - teens feel comfortable enough to set aside defenses and become unselfconsciously involved in whatever they are interested in
5. Challenge - parents provide increasingly complex opportunites for action</p>

<blockquote><p>p119. "Without training, and without an object in the external world that demands attention, people are unable to focus their thoughts for more than a few minutes at a time."</p>

<p>"We don't usually notice how little control we have over the mind, because habits channel psychic energy so well that thoughts seem to follow each other by themselves without a hitch. After sleeping we regain consciousness in the morning when the alarm rings, and then walk to the bathroom and brush our teeth. The social roles culture prescribes then take care of shaping our minds for us, and we generally place ourselves on automatic pilot till the end of the day, when it is time again to lose consciousness in sleep. But when we are left alone, with no demands on attention, the basic disorder of the mind reveals itself. With nothing to do, it begins to follow random patterns, usually stopping to consider something painful or disturbing. Unless a person knows how to give order to his or her thoughts, attention will be attracted to whatever is most problematic at the moment: it will focus on some real or imaginary pain, on recent grudges or long-term frustrations."</p>

<p>p133. "Having a record of the past can make a great contribution to the quality of life. It frees us from the tyranny of the present, and makes it possible for consciousness to revisit former times."</p>

<p>p139. "In philosophy as in other disciplines there comes a point where a person is ready to pass from the status of passive consumer to that of active producer. ... But if one records ideas in response to an inner challenge to express clearly the major questions by which one feels confronted, and tried to sketch out answers that will help make sense of one's experiences, then the amateur philosopher will have learned to derive enjoyment from one of the most difficult and rewarding tasks of life."</p>

<p>p179. "In other words, accepting limitations is liberating. For example, by making up one's mind to invest psychic energy exlussively in a monogamous marriage, regardless of any problems, obstacles, or more attractive options that may come along later, one is freed of the constant pressure of trying to maximize emotional returns."</p>

<p>p180. "For such goals to result in interactions that will help increase the complexity of its members, the family must be both differentiated and integrated. Differentiation means that each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits, maximize personal skills, set individual goals. Integration, in contrast, guarantees that what happens to one person will affect all others. If a child is proud of what she accomplished in school, the rest of the family will pay attention and will be proud of her, too. If the mother is tired and depressed, the family will try to help and cheer her up. In an integrated family, each person's goals matter to all others."</p></blockquote>

<p>How to get Optimal Experience?
1. set goals
2. become immersed in the activity
3. pay attention to what is happening
4. learning to enjoy immediate experience</p>

    <updated>2009-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.kurup.org/blog/2009/02/04/imperfection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had a lot of great plans which I've never fulfilled. Don't get me wrong. My life is beyond great and I see it getting better every day. There just happen to be a lot of things that I've planned to do which I have not done.</p>

<p>I planned to create a web-based running log. I actually did do this and used it for a long time, but I never did build in enough features to make it worthwhile for others to use. Or even enough to make it exciting for me to use.</p>

<p>I planned to create a system to help me keep track of my finances. Something that would give me a snapshot of where we are now while also letting me know if we were on track for where we want to be. I am meticulous about recording all of our financial transactions (in a great program called <a href="http://www.newartisans.com/blog/projects/ledger.html">ledger</a>), but I haven't taken the next step to easily and simply analyze that data.</p>

<p>I planned to create checklists that would make it easier to do my daily work in the hospital. There are certain things that I do everyday, or for every patient, that from time to time I forget. It's not even that I necessarily forget it. Sometimes, I just don't remember if I did it, so I have to go back and check, often finding that I <strong>didn't</strong> forget. Following a checklist would remove that doubt.</p>

<p>I planned to make my website really reflect me. It would have more stuff about my interests and the things that are happening in our lives. I read a lot and think a little and I'm sure some of these insights, however mundane, might help someone else who happens to be thinking about the same thing.</p>

<p>I planned to create a website for our family. A place where anyone in the family could create their own space to do whatever they want. A place where we could document and investigate our family tree and our family history. I actually built some of this over 10 years ago but took it down because I needed to password protect it (at the request of some family members). It's now more than 10 years later and I haven't done that simple task.</p>

<p>I planned to create a <a href="http://vikurup.com/">website for my father</a> which would talk about the great things that he has done in the world of science and now in the world of religion. Fortunately, he beat me to it, but I want to make his site even better.</p>

<p>I planned to create a website for my brother-in-law, Ethan, who is starting an <a href="http://www.lawbeattie.com/">immigration law practice here in Durham, NC</a>. This finally got done, but there are so many things to do to make it better.</p>

<p>These are just a tiny percentage of the failed projects on my list. What's the point of all of this 'woulda shoulda coulda'? I just read a great article over at defmacro.com called "<a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/taming-perfectionism.html">Taming Perfectionism</a>". It's about me. OK, I'm not 100% sure he meant to write about me, but that description is me. All of these projects that I listed are relatively simple. The reason they're not done is because whenever I think about them, I start to get overwhelmed. I cannot begin to work on one detail without thinking about the perfect way to implement that detail. Let's make a running log. OK, but first, let's model the database. Is that third-normal form? Hmmm... I wonder if I should write the unit tests before the database. Let me google 'unit testing software'. And before you know it, I'm back to my RSS reader to do some passive reading. On that vein, I happened to find this little video on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43Folders</a> at the same time that I read the "Taming Perfectionism" article. It's an oldie by <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/">Ze Frank</a>, who is amazing:</p>

<object width="350" height="278" data="http://blip.tv/play/AYqRV4L5WQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="http://blip.tv/play/AYqRV4L5WQ" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object>


<p>So, I feel like the internets are conspiring to get me to drop my perfectionism. And writing this article is my first step. I won't get everything on my todo list done, but I'm going to make an effort to be a little more imperfect. I hope you don't mind.</p>
