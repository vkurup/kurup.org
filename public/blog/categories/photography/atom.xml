    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's something about photography that seems to attract
programmers. So many of the really good programmers that I know are
also into photography. I, on the other hand, am just happy if my
latest photo of the kids doesn't include massive red eye. I'm always
happy when a shot looks nice, but I know I'm not interested enough to
be an exceptional photographer. I've never wanted a fancy SLR camera
because I know I'd leave it on the shelf collecting dust. I'd rather
have a camera that I will actually carry with me.</p>

<p>On that note, I'm really happy with the <a href="http://amzn.to/ie9DRB">Canon Powershot
S95</a> that Mala bought me. It's even tinier than
my previous pocket cameras but it takes <strong>really</strong> good photos. It's
no SLR, but I'm pretty impressed with the quality so far. I learned
from <a href="http://amzn.to/huf5fP">David Pogue's Digital Photography: The Missing
Manual</a> that image sensor size is, by far, the
most important criteria by which to compare cameras and the S95's
image sensor is huge. It's only 10 megapixels, but that is mostly a
meaningless statistics. Ignore megapixels and pay attention to the
image sensor size. I also love that it has no noticeable shutter
lag. I've been chasing running kids around the past couple days and
have yet to miss a shot.</p>

<p>If you're not a photography buff, David Pogue's <a href="http://amzn.to/huf5fP">Missing
Manual</a> has a lot of straightforward, simple
advice that will make your pics better.</p>

<p>Here's a few photos from this weekend:</p>
