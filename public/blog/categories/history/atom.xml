    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite podcasts is going on hiatus. (A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcast</a> is basically a fancy word for a radio show that you can download to your MP3 player.) <a href="http://talkinghistory.oah.org/">Talking History</a> is produced by the Organization of American Historians and because of budget problems, they cutting funding for Talking History.</p>

<p>The host Brian LeBeau is the epitome of a great interviewer. He mostly stays in the background, giving the stage to the historian, but when he asks a question, you immediately feel like it's a question that you would want to ask. He makes interviewing seem simple. It's clear that not only has he read the work of the historian he's interviewing, he understands the impact of their work. But most of all, the show is great because of the content. They choose great topics with great authors and historians. If you have any interest in history, go back and listen to their <a href="http://talkinghistory.oah.org/arch2006.html">shows for the past couple years</a> (which will remain up despite the hiatus). Hope the hiatus is short...</p>

<p>(Don't forget to <a href="https://www.oah.org/giving/index.html#Anchor-11176">donate to their cause</a> if you enjoy the content as much as I do)</p>

<p><b>History and more</b></p>

While Talking History takes its hiatus, you might check out the
Teaching Company ( http://www.teach12.com/teach12.asp?ai=16281 ). They
scout out good teachers from universities across the US for lectures
on a variety of topics.

<p><b>I'm too cheap</b></p>
<p>
You're right Prem, the content looks enticing. But, it's a little on
the expensive side and I'm really a fan of the podcast format. Let the
audio come to me :)

This is awesome!  We need more of this.  Mo' podcasts, mo' podcasts,
mo' podcasts!
</p>

It's hard to find the quality stuff, though.  The free marketplace has
been inundated.  All part of the process, I know, I know (quality will
rise to the top).  It would be cool to have a site that has a good
rating system for free podcasts.  There probably already is one or
ones like it.  Haven't seen it/them, but perhaps it can be filtered,
fine tuned.

That's my problem too. Finding good stuff. There are a few sites that claim to help you (Just do a google search for 'podcast directory'), but I haven't been overwhelmed with their usefulness.
