  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d like to become a better writer. In order to become a better writer, you simply have to write more. Funny how most things are like that. Still, sometimes you want a little more structure. MIT has a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/writing/Resources/Writers/process.html">nice guide to writing</a> that is both simple and useful. Start out by making your document <strong>writer-centric</strong>. Just get the words down on paper. Satisfy only yourself. Then, revise your writing to make it <strong>reader-centric</strong>. Add evidence, details, and explanations that your audience would need. I think this is a useful distinction because I often get bogged down thinking about what others might think when I should just be writing.</p>

I&#8217;ve only run twice since the marathon, so I took it nice and easy. I planned to run about 10 minute miles, but I felt good around mile 5, so I sped up.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>DUCK lost money both in its most recent quarter and over the past 12 months, so I sold it. I wish I&#8217;d been smarter about the way I sold it. I hadn&#8217;t decided which new stocks to buy yet, so instead of just selling DUCK and sitting in cash, I thought I&#8217;d using a trailing-stop order. With a regular stop, you tell your broker to sell the stock once the price drops below a certain point. If the current price is $23.50 and you set a stop at $23.00, then when the price drops below $23, the broker sends the order to the market and fills it. It&#8217;s a way to automatically limit your losses (or protect a certain amount of gains) in a stock. A trailing stop works the same way, except that the stop-price moves up whenever the current-price moves up. You set a trailing-stop at 50 cents below market. If the current price is $23.50, your stop is at $23.00. If the current price goes to $24, then your stop moves up with it to $23.50. I figured this would be perfect for my situation. I knew I wanted to sell DUCK. I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to buy next. If DUCK went up in this period of time, I&#8217;d benefit. If DUCK went down, I&#8217;d lose very little.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. The stocks that I own are thinly traded - they&#8217;re small and unknown. You always want to use limit orders for these type of stocks. But all stop-loss orders are really market orders. The broker holds onto them until the price hits the stop and then sends the order to the market as a market-order. So, in my case, DUCK closed at 23.49 on the day before my order. I placed a trailing-stop at 50 cents. DUCK opened at 21.50. The trailing-stop triggered and my order filled at 21.60. The stock price then jumped back to 23.50 and remained there. I got screwed! The real problem is that I got greedy. Instead of hoping for a few extra pennies per share, I should have just set a limit order at $23.00 and forgotten about it. Live and learn. Either I want a stock in my portfolio or I don&#8217;t. Squeezing extra pennies out of it is not the way to get rich.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It looks like a fish shack, but the service is much more attentive. We had clam chowder and crabcakes as appetizers, then the fish &amp; chips and BLT tuna sandwich as entrees. The tuna was seared just on the edges. It was mixed with bacon, hard-boiled eggs, and avocado on fresh chewy bread. Mala says, &#8220;Best Tuna Fish sandwich ever,&#8221; and I can&#8217;t argue. All of the fried stuff was delicious and not too greasy. It&#8217;s more expensive than any other place with &#8220;Shack&#8221; in the title, but the food is good enough to make it worth it. Great beer list as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the commute from hell this morning. The 4 train went &#8220;Out of service&#8221; at 149th street, so we all got off and crowded onto the other nearly-full 4 train going downtown. They closed the doors for a minute, then opened the doors and said &#8216;This 4 is out of service&#8217;. So now there are 2 train-fulls of people trying to get to the 5 train downstairs. It was chaos. I was able to squeeze onto the second 5 train that came by and then we waited there for like 10 minutes. We went 1 stop to 138th street and waited for another 10-20 minutes. We finally got to 125th street. I usually switch to the 6 train at 125th because it goes local to 96th street. The 4 and 5 trains go express to 86th. So, anyway, we get to 125th and I see the 6 train waiting there, so I cross over. Big mistake. The 6 train waited for 5 minutes and then said they would be delayed. They recommended that everyone go outside and get the M101 bus! I waited for a while, just cuz I was too lazy to go up. Thirty seconds after the announcement, they closed the doors and said that the train would be going express to 86th street. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t leave to get the bus. So, I finally get to my destination, an hour later than usual, 10 blocks further downtown from where I wanted to be. I usually don&#8217;t complain about the subway, but this has happened a lot. Their service in the Bronx is much worse than in it was in Manhattan.</p>

<p><b>the greatest city deserve a better transportation system</b></p>
<p>
This pattern of service from MTA is continually occurring everyday and
it is getting worse. It took me 2 and a half hours from borough hall
to jewel avenue today. Everyone is saying take mass transit, take mass
transit but over and over again a half an hour journey by car is
taking upwards of 2 or more hours and we are traveling on rails
unheeded by traffic c,mon.and it is taking flipping forever.  time is
important and production hours of the entire N.Y workforce is
frustrated and the growth of the city suffers from this
transportation.How hard is it to not spend money on bright lights and
noisy trains which acoustically can be quieter inside and outside, but
that is another topic on the train, but on evaluating the existing
transportation network and just give us the service please. I wish
there was some sort of competition, maybe efficient dollar vans to run
efficiently all over the mta routes and make a size able dent into
their bottomline and i bet the service would improve immediately. This
dumping passengers from 2 trains unto a packed third and telling them
to PLEASE be patient. over and over again and get off the train there
is another one behind. (May Take Awhile)(MTA)needs to know if this
service continues jobs are at risk.we are now more advanced than this
service now. More growth is coming and by the way the 5 should be
express all the time from 180th to 3rd ave in the bronx.  the 2 train
runs local there anyway. Maybe if the neighbourhood was getting
gentrification then the service might get the #5 express at all
times.The double standard service for Manhattan is different from the
Boroughs and it needs to be stopped its unnecessary.

problem attitude EVERYONE PLEASE LEAVE THE TRAIN.Can someone please

<p><b>Agree</b></p>
<p>
Also got a ticket, e 180th st on the five, moving from a packed car to
an empty one. Mta police are suppose to protect not fine every chance
they get, what is there to expect !!! these guys are fresh out of high
school. anyway, the 5 express isn&#8217;t really an express to me in the
Bronx, an express isn&#8217;t suppose to stop at Simpson st because of train
traffic. the 2 local, ha . unreliable . heres my thing, metro north is
one of the best performing transportation systems within the mta and
nation. why is that, metro north mainly serves westchester
county. westchester county is ranked as the nations top ten county. so
let lets think about. &#8221; ahhh, who cares about the poor to middle class
residents in the outer boroughs. but the rich get reliable
service. today two five expresses to 238th went out of service without
reason, adding an extra 15 minutes to the commute.

<p><b>Queens service sounds better, but not by much</b></p>
<p>
From the Jackson Heights area it&#8217;s not uncommon to sit on a train with
two or more train loads of people because trains are late, upwards of
an hour late.  Service here is much worse than in Manhattan, too.  And
to add just plain insult, trains running so far out from Manhattan
reach Roosevelt Ave running local-a 25 minute+ journey inside of
Queens alone-due to construction on the express tracks and then run
express like &#8220;normal&#8221; the rest of the way out.  WTF.  Somehow this is
tricking people at the end of the line into thinking there&#8217;s some sort
of normal service?  Bullshit.  Alternate trains, do something
different.  Having 4 of the same train pass a stop before a local
train arrives is just a waste of fucking trains.  Everybody who works
for the thing should be fired.  Out of a cannon.  Into the side of an
aircraft carrier.  Head first.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw this great idea over at this place called Raganwald. <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2005/11/off-topic-raganadvertising.html">Only show ads to visitors who come in from search engines.</a> I really don&#8217;t want friends and family to see ads, so this effectively shields them since they will probably come here by typing kurup.org in the address bar or using a bookmark.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re welcome :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/napa-etched-door.jpg" alt="Amazing etched door" />{: .inset .right height=150 width=113} We honeymooned in California Wine Country. We stayed at the <a href="http://www.winecountryhilton.com/">Hilton in Santa Rosa</a>, about halfway between Napa and Sonoma. In Napa, we visited <a href="http://www.sterlingvineyards.com/">Sterling</a>, <a href="http://www.peju.com/">Peju</a>, <a href="http://www.vsattui.com/">V. Sattui</a> and <a href="http://www.artesawinery.com/">Artesa</a>. I enjoy wine, but not to the point that I can tell the difference between a good wine and a great one. So, I grade vineyards on different criteria. Go to Sterling for the view and the self-guided tour. Go to Peju to see the stained glass and the etched door. Go to V. Sattui for the free wine tasting, the gourmet deli and the picnic area. Go to Artesa because, well, it&#8217;s a nice stop on the way back to San Francisco.</p>

<p>I had my first-ever massage at the <a href="http://www.goldenhaven.com/">Golden Haven Hot Springs</a> in Calistoga. We also did the couples mud-bath and spa. They say the mud in Calistoga is therapeutic because of the hot springs. It seemed like regular old mud to me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ribeye.jpg" alt="Mmmm Ribeye" />{: .inset .left height=150 width=113} <img src="/images/mirepoix.jpg" alt="Mirepoix" />{: .inset .left height=150 width=113} Our favorite meal was at <a href="http://www.aubergedusoleil.com/html/restaurant.shtml">Auberge du Soleil</a>. We had the tasting menu and every course was spectacular, especially the rib-eye. Get an outdoor table at sunset and you won&#8217;t be disappointed. Thanks to Sarika for the recommendation. We found another quaint little place in Windsor called <a href="http://www.restaurantmirepoix.com/">Mirepoix</a>. The service was very friendly and the food was great. We were not as impressed with Greystone Restaurant - the Culinary Institute of America&#8217;s restaurant. It was fine, but not as good as our other meals.</p>

<p>We liked hanging out at the vineyards in Sonoma better than Napa. It just seemed more relaxed and the wine tastings were cheaper. We tasted at <a href="http://www.ferrari-carano.com/">Ferrari Carano</a>, <a href="http://closdubois.com/">Clos du Bois</a> and <a href="http://www.simiwinery.com/">Simi</a>. Don&#8217;t miss the meticulously manicured gardens at Ferrari Carano.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ferrari-carano.jpg" alt="Ferrari-Carano cellars" />{: .inset height=112 width=150} <img src="/images/mala-vinod-garden.jpg" alt="Beautiful garden" />{: .inset height=80 width=150} <img src="/images/fountain.jpg" alt="Peju fountain" />{: .inset height=112 width=150}</p>

<p><img src="/images/arch-rock.jpg" alt="Arch Rock" />{: .inset .left height=112 width=150} <img src="/images/tiny-mala.jpg" alt="Mala is tiny!" />{: .inset .right height=150 width=113} We had a bread, wine and cheese picnic in the <a href="http://www.russianrivertravel.com/parks-armstrong.htm">Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve</a>. We couldn&#8217;t resist the draw of the Pacific Ocean, so we drove a couple hours west through some beautiful winding wooded roads. We declined the dip into the ocean because it was a bit chilly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/peter.jpg" alt="Sung &amp; Peter" />{: .inset .left height=150 width=113} We drove back to San Francisco, just in time, apparently, for the Ghirardelli Square Chocolate Festival. The crowds were huge. Who knew that <a href="/images/sf-chocolate.jpg">so many people loved chocolate</a>? Sung, Lei, Peter, Jay, Cody, Andy and Nicci celebrated our departure with some great Chinese food. What was the name of that place? The dumplings were amazing!</p>

<p>Our honeymoon was over, but our adventures aren&#8217;t. Next in the series: Our trip to France! (This blog is getting exciting now, isn&#8217;t it?)</p>
