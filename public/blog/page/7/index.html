  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found out how to rotate video today. I often take video with my
Canon SD870, but I mistakenly take it in portrait mode. I don&#8217;t
realize this until I&#8217;m editing the video and then I have to decide if
I want to subject my adoring youtube fans to the torture of having to
turn their heads sideways to see how cute Kavi and Anika are.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRotateAnAVIOrMPEGFileTakenInPortrait.aspx">this
link</a>
which gives the <code>mencoder</code> command to rotate the video. Unfortunately,
it didn&#8217;t work with the AVI files that my Canon SD870 create. I think
this camera creates slightly corrupt AVI files. I say &#8220;slightly&#8221;
because they&#8217;re still viewable, but mplayer always reports the total
time as &#8220;0:00&#8221;, even while the elapsed time marches along
correctly. Well, today, I found a way to fix the AVI files.</p>

<pre><code>mencoder -ovc copy -oac copy input.avi -o output.avi
</code></pre>

<p>This just creates a new AVI, copying the video and audio from the
original. Now, mplayer reports the correct total time. Then, to rotate
the video:</p>

<pre><code>mencoder -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg -vf rotate=1 \
         -oac copy output.avi -o rotated.avi
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s your reward for reading along:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I preordered Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Up-Running-Mark-Pilgrim/dp/0596806027?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diveintomark-20&amp;creativeASIN=0596806027">HTML5, Up and Running</a> from Amazon back in
March. It&#8217;s available for free as <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">Dive into
HTML5</a>. I&#8217;ve been a fan of Mark&#8217;s <a href="http://diveintomark.org">writing</a>
for a while, so buying the book was a way to thank him &#8220;with a
buck&#8221;. Interestingly, the online book and paper book are not
identical. For starters, the titles are different. In addition, the
beautiful fonts and cutesy images of the online version are gone. The
paper book is your run-of-the-mill O&#8217;Reilly book. I&#8217;m not sure if
it&#8217;ll make much of a difference in my enjoyment, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>As I said, I preordered the book in March, so I had no idea when it
would be finished and delivered. It showed up on my doorstep this
morning, on my birthday! We&#8217;re on our way to NYC tomorrow for our
first trip back there since we moved to North Carolina in 2007, so I
know have some light pleasure reading. Perfect Timing!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only read the first chapter so far, but I think I&#8217;m going to love
it. I&#8217;ve done a lot of web programming in my life, but only maintain
my own sites now. I&#8217;m reading this book like a programmer might read a
book on astronomy&#8230; purely for the love of it. The first chapter goes
into the details of how the <code>IMG</code> tag was invented. Marc Andreessen
mentioned it on a mailing list back in 1993, and after some back and
forth, shipped it in Mosaic, an early browser. Because it shipped and
because it was popular, it got included in the HTML standards.</p>

<p>I still remember when Mosaic came out. I got my first email address in
1992 (vkurup@macc.wisc.edu) and somehow was on a mailing list
announcing the impending release of Mosaic. I remember the text of the
email basically saying that &#8220;This will change the world.&#8221; Once I saw
it, I thought it was cool, but way over-hyped. Who is going to want to
wait for pictures to download over a 14.4K modem? Ridiculous. This is
why you should not take my advice about new trends.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point of the <code>IMG</code> example is to show that HTML standards
have never been &#8220;pure&#8221;, but have always been influenced by the
implementers and the users of the web. The way it should be. HTML5 is
an acknowledgment of that fact.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to be a primary care physician, but switched to being a hospitalist
in 2007. I loved parts about being a PCP, namely the relationship that I
developed with the patient over many years. I miss that. I think PCPs offer
huge value in providing low cost, quality care, especially if they can stay
engaged throughout the hospitalization process. Atul Gawande recently wrote
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/02/100802fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all">a powerful article on the Hospice system</a>. It&#8217;s
worth reading to being to understand the complex issues involved in
end-of-life care, not to mention for the emotional storytelling that is his
strength. But, to me, the unsung hero in that story was Chuck Morris, the
primary care physician, who came in at the proper moment and provided
perspective to the patient that he knew so well, allowing them to make the
sane, yet horribly difficult decision to pursue a palliative path. Reading
that made me miss primary care medicine a little. I perform much more
actual &#8220;medical&#8221; work as a hospitalist than I ever did as a PCP. But, when
I think of the concept of a <em>doctor</em>, in my head, I&#8217;m thinking of a primary
care doc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Braindump time. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve read about clojure in the past few days. I don&#8217;t understand what this means yet, but maybe someday I will:</p>

<blockquote><p>Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure
that calls to Java can avoid reflection.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are multiple languages that target the JVM (besides Java, of
course). It seems that there are 2 classes of languages. Ported languages
such as JRuby and Jython aim to be identical to their base languages
(Ruby &amp; Python). Native languages such as Clojure and Groovy are meant to
target the JVM natively without satisfying any desire to be identical to
another language. Native languages have the advantage that they only have 1
set of libraries to use, so you don&#8217;t get stuck between two languages.</p>

<p>I installed clojure 1.0 from the ubuntu repositories, but promptly
uninstalled it once I found
<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">leiningen</a>. Leiningen is a build
tool for clojure. You can easily create a new project and specify its
dependencies and leiningen will download those dependencies, including a
full version of clojure for each project. You can have 1 project using
leiningen 1.0 and another using version 1.2 sitting right next to it. That
seems smart!</p>

<p>I installed <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Emacs">clojure-mode on
emacs</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, I&#8217;m working my way through the
<a href="http://github.com/relevance/labrepl">labrepl</a> project. It&#8217;s an interactive
tutorial and REPL (read-eval-print-loop) where you can run the examples in
the tutotial.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always important to know how to find help:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(doc blah)</code> gives documentation about blah.</li>
<li><code>(find-doc "blah")</code> searches for documentation.</li>
<li><code>(javadoc blah)</code> opens Java docs in your browser</li>
<li><code>(show java.util.Date)</code> shows method signatures</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s something cool: Maps are associative arrays. Here&#8217;s a simple one:</p>

<pre><code>(def me {:first-name "Vinod", :last-name "Kurup"})
</code></pre>

<p>To get the data, you use the <code>get</code> function, like you would in other languages:</p>

<pre><code>(get me :first-name) -&gt; "Vinod"
</code></pre>

<p>But, maps and keywords are functions as well, so you can do:</p>

<pre><code>(me :first-name) -&gt; "Vinod"
(:last-name me) -&gt; "Kurup"
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use bluetooth to transfer podcasts from my laptop to my Palm Centro. A
Palm Centro is like an iPhone or a Droid, except less <strong>smart</strong>-like and
more <strong>phone</strong>-like. This worked beautifully but broke when I upgraded to
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download">Ubuntu</a> 10.04 (Lucid
Lynx). There are 2 bugs involved. First, the bluetooth daemon
(<code>/usr/sbin/bluetoothd</code>) never gets started. Second, there&#8217;s no easy way to
start the file transfer daemon automatically (<code>/usr/bin/dund</code>). This used
to work automatically, but now it doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve tried to fiddle with <code>udev</code>
rules, but have been unsuccessful. I&#8217;ve reported the 2 bugs, but haven&#8217;t
had any response
yet. <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/589464">(bluetoothd bug)</a>
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/559538">(dund bug)</a></p>

<p>My workaround is a shell script which starts those those daemons if they
are not running:</p>

<h4>vk-bluetooth-start.sh</h4>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

BLUETOOTH='bluetoothd'
DUN='dund'

# first start bluetoothd
if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep $BLUETOOTH &gt; /dev/null
then
    echo "$BLUETOOTH is running."
else
    echo -n "Starting $BLUETOOTH..."
    /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/bluetoothd -u &amp;&gt; /dev/null
    echo "done."
fi

# then start dund
if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep $DUN &gt; /dev/null
then
    echo "$DUN is running."
else
    echo -n "Starting $DUN..."
    /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/dund --listen --persist --msdun call centro
    echo "done."
fi
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s my script which transfers the files to my phone. It uses
<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/pilot-link">pilot-link</a>, which I had to
compile from source due to a
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pilot-link/+bug/592916">bug in the way that the Ubuntu version addresses large SD cards</a>. This
should be fixed in the next version of Ubuntu.</p>

<h4>vk-transfer-podcasts.sh</h4>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

output=$(pilot-xfer -p net:any -D /Kingston/AUDIO -i *.mp3 2&gt;&amp;1)
errors=$(echo $output | grep -c "ERROR:")

if [ $errors -gt 0 ] ; then
    echo "failure (count: $errors)"
    echo $output
else
    echo -n "success, removing files from laptop..."
    /bin/rm -I $HOME/*.mp3
    echo "done."
fi
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why I use a slow protocol like bluetooth to transfer
large files to an SD card, rather than just ejecting the SD card and
inserting it into the laptop, well&#8230; you haven&#8217;t tried to access the SD
card on a Palm Centro. #paininthe&amp;<sup>@!</sup></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last night shift was a little less busy than most, so I forced myself to pick something about each patient I admitted and look it up. I tend to do this anyway, but I never keep notes or write about it. Here&#8217;s what I wrote about that night:</p>

<h3>Does Buspar (buspirone) need to be tapered?</h3>

<p>Answer: No. The full report on Micromedex was a little conflicting, because it stated that there may be some withdrawal symptoms from Buspar, but this quote in the same profile suggests otherwise:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data suggest that buspirone does not cause physical dependence and as such, no withdrawal effects have been noted (Rickels et al, 1988a; Tyrer et al, 1985; Cole et al, 1982).</p></blockquote>

<h3>Staging COPD</h3>

<p>I always forget the cutoffs for the stages of COPD. There are 2 different guidleines - GOLD and ATS/ARS, but fortunately they are almost identical:</p>

<p>Patients need to have an FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70. Staging is then based on the FEV1.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage I (Mild): FEV1 > 80% predicted</li>
<li>Stage II (Moderate): FEV1 50-80% predicted</li>
<li>Stage III (Severe): FEV1 30-50% predicted</li>
<li>Stage IV: (Very Severe): FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted, or &lt; 50% with signs of chronic respiratory failure</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to determine calorie level of ADA diet?</h3>

<p>We always put diabetic patients on an ADA diet and I choose the calorie level by gestalt. I figured there must be some formula to calculate the calorie level based on the patient&#8217;s weight. Looking it up, I found a different answer altogether. The ADA no longer recommends an ADA diet in the hospital. Instead, they recommend a consistent-carbohydrate diet. In long-term care facilities (i.e. nursing homes), they go a step further and recommend a &#8216;Regular&#8217; diet with consistency in the amount and timing of carbohydrate. They specifically state that there is no evidence to support the classic &#8216;No concentrated sweets&#8217; diet. These guidelines are from 2007, but they obviously have not been widely disseminated yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is recommended that the term “ADA diet” no longer be used, since the ADA no longer endorses a single nutrition prescription or percentages of macronutrients.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I blogged daily for a 6 day stretch a couple weeks ago, which is the
longest continuous stretch I&#8217;ve ever done. It was stimulating and stressful
at the same time. I haven&#8217;t heard from the Pulitzer committee about any of
the posts yet, but it&#8217;s not the quality that matters. Writing is more about
the process than the product, and I know from experience that writing helps
me think. And while most of the posts were written for my own benefit, I
really enjoyed the response that I got from family and friends about
<a href="/blog/2010/07/15/playdoh">Playdoh</a>. I think I&#8217;ve read that post 100 times
and I still laugh out loud at the end of it. That&#8217;s the post that started
the stretch off. As soon as I had put Kavi to bed, I knew that I wanted to
share that story. I wrote it down quickly, so I wouldn&#8217;t forget it. That
writing process stimulated me to want to write more, so I made it an
internal goal to write a post daily.</p>

<p>Then I had two night shifts and the streak was broken. I&#8217;ve had a few days
off, but I still haven&#8217;t written anything. I&#8217;m still learning clojure, but
I fear writing about something that I know nothing about. Even though I&#8217;ve
heard others say that this is the best time to write about a topic. I&#8217;ve
also constructed a vicious cycle in my head. I want to learn clojure. I
want to write about what I learn. I start doing so, but then I skip a day
or so. Now, when I have free time, I think about learning clojure, but then
I also think about the fact that I should write about it. And since I&#8217;m
already behind, I don&#8217;t want to get further behind, so maybe I shouldn&#8217;t
read that interesting tutorial until I&#8217;ve caught up on writing about what
I&#8217;ve learned. Next thing I know, I&#8217;m monitoring Twitter streams
second-by-second for <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur</a> links.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping that writing about my mental blocks will help me overcome
them. I plan to write more frequently, mostly for my own benefit, but I&#8217;m
not going to let it get in the way of learning cool, interesting stuff. If
my writing is disjointed, so be it. I can fill in the gaps later if anyone
cares.</p>

<a href="http://youtube.com/vkurup1">videos that we take of the kids</a>. I haven&#8217;t
found a Linux program which was as nice as iMovie was on the Mac, but kino
is pretty good. It&#8217;s easy to splice and reconnect video clips together. It
has nice special effects, though my needs are pretty simple. It&#8217;s able to
export in plenty of formats, possibly too many, for my simple mind. But,
I&#8217;ve figured it out and have a stable process for getting video from camera
to youtube.</p>

<p>I have 3 camcorders - a <a href="http://www.theflip.com/">Flip</a>, my Canon digital
camera, and a Panasonic DVD camcorder. I can just copy the AVI files
directly off the Flip and the Canon&#8217;s SD card. The Panasonic records all of
the video clips into a single file with a .VRO extension. I found a great
utility called <a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/programs/dvd-vr/">dvd-vr</a>, which
reads that file and splits it into individual AVI files. Once I have a
directory full of AVI files from the various camcorders, I use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> to rename them consistently. I
open up 2 buffers: an editable dired buffer (<code>wdired-change-to-wdired-mode</code>)
of the movies directory, and a shell buffer in that same directory. I run a
macro which takes the first file in the directory, plays it via an mplayer
command in the shell buffer and then renames the file using the
date/timestamp of the file. The macro leaves the cursor in a spot where I
can enter a brief description of the video and then run the macro again to
do the next video. It works pretty well. I then batch convert them to DV
format, which is what Kino accepts. Finally, I launch Kino and edit the
files, add titles, export them to AVI again, and then upload them to
youtube.</p>

<p>I did this today and ran into a problem with kino. The video played at
breakneck speed and there was no audio. Google helped me figure out that
this was a problem between PulseAudio and kino. Kino is no longer actively
developed. The lead developer considers it stable and finished and he&#8217;s
moved on to other endeavors, which is perfectly understandable. He&#8217;s
however, taken the time to describe
<a href="http://www.kinodv.org/article/view/173/1/13/">a workaround</a>. He recommends
running <code>padsp kino</code> which routes all audio requests from kino to
pulseaudio. This worked, but the audio had a lot of feedback. I found an
even better
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8367831&amp;postcount=7">workaround on the ubuntu forums</a>. Use
<code>pasuspender kino</code>, which suspends all PulseAudio activity, gives kino
direct access to audio devices, and then resumes PulseAudio once kino has
quit. This worked with perfect audio quality, though of course, audio from
any other program gets muted completely.</p>

<p>I am still on the lookout for a better video editing solution on
Linux. Eventually, I&#8217;d like to make DVDs of the hundreds of little clips
that I have. They don&#8217;t need to be fancy, but I would like to have some
basic menus and they need to work on standard DVD players. I&#8217;ve started
doing a little research on this, so will post once I&#8217;ve tried some things
out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you asked me a few years ago, I would have said you absolutely can&#8217;t
time the stock market. The 2008 crash hurt enough to make me review my
convictions a little. I still believe that accurate market timing is
somewhere between difficult and impossible. Trying to analyze stock charts
to figure out what will happen in the short term is mostly a crap
shoot. The way to win in the stock market is to buy value stocks,
especially when everyone else is selling.</p>

<p>I do, however, now believe that there is a place for market timing in
deciding when to be in the stock market, in the first place. I think there
are some trends that have repeatedly predicted poor stock
performance. There are some super smart people that have analyzed these
trends over at the <a href="http://boards.fool.com">Motley Fool message
boards</a>. They&#8217;ve come up with many indicators that
supposedly tell you when to get in and out of the stock market, but my
favorite is the <a href="http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=27442724">99 day
rule</a> <a href="A">^1</a>.</p>

<p>The basic premise of the 99 day rule is that when the
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=^GSPC">S&amp;P 500 Index</a> stops making new highs,
investors get pessimistic and stocks fall. When it starts making new highs
again, optimism takes over and bull markets start. The 99 day rule has 2
parts and coincidentally uses 99 days as the cut-off for both parts. It
looks at whether a new high has been made recently. It defines &#8220;high&#8221; as a
99-day high. It defines &#8220;recently&#8221; as 99 days. So, it looks for a new
99-day high within the last 99 days. The number is arbitrary. Hop over the
the
<a href="http://boards.fool.com/mechanical-investing-100093.aspx">Motley Fool boards</a>
to see how the dates have been tuned and pick different ones, if you like.</p>

<p>I like this rule, because it&#8217;s simple, easy to calculate and doesn&#8217;t have
many &#8220;signals&#8221;, so you&#8217;re not constantly buying and selling. Of course,
it&#8217;s not perfect, but it would have gotten you out of most of the major
bear markets.</p>

<p>Here is how the rule has done over time:</p>

<pre><code>Period        S&amp;P 500   Switching   Improvement 
---------     -------   ---------   -----------
1930-1935     -12.2%       4.3%       16.4% 
1935-1940      10.3%      16.2%        6.0% 
1940-1945       7.4%       5.6%       -1.8% 
1945-1950      10.2%       7.4%       -2.8% 
1950-1955      23.6%      22.5%       -1.1% 
1955-1960      15.2%      13.8%       -1.4% 
1960-1965      10.7%      11.7%        1.0%

1980-1985      14.8%      20.1%        5.2% 
1985-1990      20.4%      18.8%       -1.7% 
1990-1995       8.7%       6.7%       -2.0% 
1995-2000      28.6%      27.9%       -0.7% 
2000-2005      -2.3%       4.3%        6.6% 
2005-early2008  2.0%       4.5%        2.5%
</code></pre>

<p>You may have gotten to this point and are now wondering why it&#8217;s worth
following this rule. In at least 3 of the past 5 periods, this signal would
have lost money versus staying in the market. That is true. The key is to
understand that there is no free lunch. Any rule that tries to get you out
of major bear markets will be imperfect and will often leave you with less
money than if you had chosen to act on a different date (or not act at
all). The overall goal is not to increase your returns, but to decrease
your risk without sacrificing your returns. This signal does that. Overall,
it does actually increase your returns by about 2% annually since 1930.</p>

<p>The other nice feature is that it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;slam-dunk&#8221; feel to it. My
experience is that things that work in the stock market have to have a
little of a &#8220;gut wrenching&#8221; feel to them. If it sounds too good to be true,
it is. This rule feels correct, improves returns over the long run, is
backtested well, but does so at the risk of some lower performing
years. That feels a little gut-wrenching to me.</p>

<p>Here is the author&#8217;s (<a href="http://www.stonewellfunds.com/">mungofitch</a>) description:</p>

<blockquote><p>By using the rule that I described above, you would have had
a total return of 11.80%, with a total risk of 6.71%. So, you
would have had 2.3% per year higher returns on average,
while experiencing only about 56.9% of the risk.
Higher returns, lower risk. That sounds good, right?</p>

<p>But, is this one of those iffy timing systems that really only works
because it managed to avoid the crash of 1987 of something?
No, actually it has you in the market in the 1987 crash: it&#8217;s
not perfect. But does it really add value on average through the years?
Not always, but pretty darned well. Sometimes you do a little worse,
but never a lot worse. And when you do better, you do a LOT better.
So, overall, it&#8217;s worth it.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to keep track of the signal, I wrote a <a href="http://github.com/vkurup/ninety-nine">little python
program</a> to calculate whether we are
in buy mode or sell mode. It uses the excellent <a href="http://www.goldb.org/ystockquote.html">ystockquote
module</a> written by Corey Goldberg.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As mentioned yesterday, I&#8217;m teaching myself clojure. I started by trying to
install it.</p>

<pre><code>vinod@ike$ aptitude install clojure
</code></pre>

<p>Ubuntu has packaged version 1.0.0 of clojure. I always default to the
OS-installed version of programs, just for ease of maintenance. The current
stable version of clojure is 1.1 and it appears that 1.2 is in beta. I have
no idea what has been changed in 1.1 or 1.2, but I&#8217;m going to try to get
along using 1.0.0 and update only if I need to for a specific reason.</p>

<p>I then read through the
<a href="http://www.moxleystratton.com/article/clojure/for-non-lisp-programmers">tutorial for non-lisp programmers</a>,
which succinctly describes the basics of the language.<a href="I">^1</a> Everything in
lisp is either an atom or a list. Atoms include numbers, booleans, strings,
symbols, keywords and the nil value. Lists (delimited by parentheses <code>()</code>)
are the basic data structure, but include representations such as vectors
(delimited by square brackets <code>[]</code>) and maps (delimited by curly brackets
<code>{}</code>). Clojure programs are themselves simply lists, which leads to the
power of lisp-like languages because code and data are interchangeable.</p>

<p>You use <code>def</code> to create variables and <code>defn</code> to create functions. The
language includes loops and conditional statements, just like any other
useful language. Only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are <em>false</em> in clojure; zero (0),
and the empty string (&#8220;&#8221;) are <em>true</em>, unlike a lot of languages.</p>

<p>The interesting part is the integration with Java. To instantiate a java
object, simply call <code>new</code>:</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (new java.util.Date)
#&lt;Date Sun Jul 18 16:20:54 EDT 2010&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To call object methods or get instance/class variables, use the dot &#8220;.&#8221;
method.</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (. (new java.util.Date) (toString))
"Sun Jul 18 16:24:09 EDT 2010"

user=&gt; (. Integer MAX_VALUE)
2147483647
</code></pre>

<p>The article contains this interesting quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sequences are in a sense, the core of idiomatic Clojure
programming. Understand sequences and the forms that work with them, and
you will have cleared one of the biggest hurdles in writing significant
Clojure programs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, add that to my to-do list. Where to go next? A
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/599519/which-tutorial-on-clojure-is-best">StackOverflow thread</a>
has pointed to me to a few options. I&#8217;ll probably read one of these next:</p>
