  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another piece of advice that I&#8217;ve heard over and over again is to make
things easier. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/09/how-to-be-dispensable-and-why-you-should-document-and-automate-yourself-out-of-a-job/">Automate!</a>
In that vein, I learned a little elisp in order to make it easier to
create a new blog post. I create my posts in emacs, but I often cut
and paste the YAML header from a previous post, which is tedious and
time-consuming. Here is my new posting function:</p>

<pre><code>(defun vk-blogpost (title)
  "Create a new blog post."
  (interactive "sPost Title: ")
  (let ((slug (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase title))))
    (find-file (concat "~/web/kurup.org/_posts/"
                       (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")
                       "-" slug ".markdown"))
    (insert "---\n")
    (insert "date: " (format-time-string "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S") "\n")
    (insert "layout: post\n")
    (insert "title: " title "\n")
    (insert "categories: \n")
    (insert "---\n\n")))
</code></pre>

<p>After asking me for a title, it creates a new file and massages the
title to create a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(web_publishing">slug</a>). It
automatically enters the date of the post, both in the filename and
in the YAML header. This took me about an hour to write, mostly in
googling elisp commands. Hopefully, it will save time in the long run,
but even if it doesn&#8217;t, it was fun to write :-)</p>

<p>Any feedback on my primitive elisp would be appreciated!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found this <a href="http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=195">great article on
writing</a> by Sebastian
Marshall. His basic advice boils down to &#8220;just do it!&#8221;, but he makes
some interesting points along the way. I had never heard of the
Equal-Odds rule. Read more details at his blog, but basically, in
order to do great work, you have to do a lot of &#8220;not-great&#8221; work. No
one just does great work. So, let go and just write. The great stuff
will float to the top.</p>

<p>Commit to doing it every day, no matter what. I don&#8217;t know how many
times I&#8217;ve heard this, yet I still don&#8217;t do it. I guess it&#8217;s like I
tell my smokers who tell me they&#8217;ve tried to quit so many times. Each
quit attempt is preparation for the time that you really quit. You
never know when it&#8217;s going to stick, so just keep trying.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I accepted that I&#8217;m going to be judged. I don&#8217;t love it, but I
accepted it.</em>&#8221; This is the hardest part for me. My ego is fragile, but
oh well. The benefits are worth the risks.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Try to think of each visitor as an honored guest.</em>&#8221; I like that. My
site gets minimal traffic, but that&#8217;s not zero. And I actually know
some of the people that read &#8230; don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t embarrass them
by naming names. The bottom line is that my whole purpose is to
improve the lives of others, in whatever small way possible. To think
that <strong>anyone</strong> is spending their precious time reading this is an honor
to me.</p>

<p>I may never be the prolific writer that I envision myself being, but
it can&#8217;t hurt to keep trying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.russfeingold.org/">Russ Feingold</a> lost his U.S. Senate
race. I haven&#8217;t been following Wisconsin politics since I left 14
years ago, but this makes me sad. The last time that I really cared
about the U.S. political landscape was 1992. I was 21 and in college
at the University of Wisconsin and was voting for the first time. Bill
Clinton was generating excitement, especially on college campuses, but
I was more interested in Russ Feingold&#8217;s campaign. He was a no-name
state senator, running against incumbent Bob Kasten. He seemed honest,
funny and down-to-earth. He painted his campaign promises on his
garage door so that everyone would be able to hold him to them. I
remember people saying that if he won, he&#8217;d change. The amazing thing
is that he didn&#8217;t. In 3 terms in the Senate, he has continued to stay
humble, while also crossing the aisle at times and voting against
popular, but misguided policies like the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>After the 1992 election, I remember thinking that real change was
coming. I know that the main reason that I was so excited in 1992 was
because it was my first time being a part of the political process. Of
course, as we all know, not much ever changes in U.S. politics. I&#8217;ve
come to realize and accept that. Russ Feingold was an exception and
seeing him lose, despite having lived up to his high standards, makes
me sad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found out how to rotate video today. I often take video with my
Canon SD870, but I mistakenly take it in portrait mode. I don&#8217;t
realize this until I&#8217;m editing the video and then I have to decide if
I want to subject my adoring youtube fans to the torture of having to
turn their heads sideways to see how cute Kavi and Anika are.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRotateAnAVIOrMPEGFileTakenInPortrait.aspx">this
link</a>
which gives the <code>mencoder</code> command to rotate the video. Unfortunately,
it didn&#8217;t work with the AVI files that my Canon SD870 create. I think
this camera creates slightly corrupt AVI files. I say &#8220;slightly&#8221;
because they&#8217;re still viewable, but mplayer always reports the total
time as &#8220;0:00&#8221;, even while the elapsed time marches along
correctly. Well, today, I found a way to fix the AVI files.</p>

<pre><code>mencoder -ovc copy -oac copy input.avi -o output.avi
</code></pre>

<p>This just creates a new AVI, copying the video and audio from the
original. Now, mplayer reports the correct total time. Then, to rotate
the video:</p>

<pre><code>mencoder -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg -vf rotate=1 \
         -oac copy output.avi -o rotated.avi
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#8217;s your reward for reading along:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I preordered Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Up-Running-Mark-Pilgrim/dp/0596806027?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diveintomark-20&amp;creativeASIN=0596806027">HTML5, Up and Running</a> from Amazon back in
March. It&#8217;s available for free as <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">Dive into
HTML5</a>. I&#8217;ve been a fan of Mark&#8217;s <a href="http://diveintomark.org">writing</a>
for a while, so buying the book was a way to thank him &#8220;with a
buck&#8221;. Interestingly, the online book and paper book are not
identical. For starters, the titles are different. In addition, the
beautiful fonts and cutesy images of the online version are gone. The
paper book is your run-of-the-mill O&#8217;Reilly book. I&#8217;m not sure if
it&#8217;ll make much of a difference in my enjoyment, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>As I said, I preordered the book in March, so I had no idea when it
would be finished and delivered. It showed up on my doorstep this
morning, on my birthday! We&#8217;re on our way to NYC tomorrow for our
first trip back there since we moved to North Carolina in 2007, so I
know have some light pleasure reading. Perfect Timing!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only read the first chapter so far, but I think I&#8217;m going to love
it. I&#8217;ve done a lot of web programming in my life, but only maintain
my own sites now. I&#8217;m reading this book like a programmer might read a
book on astronomy&#8230; purely for the love of it. The first chapter goes
into the details of how the <code>IMG</code> tag was invented. Marc Andreessen
mentioned it on a mailing list back in 1993, and after some back and
forth, shipped it in Mosaic, an early browser. Because it shipped and
because it was popular, it got included in the HTML standards.</p>

<p>I still remember when Mosaic came out. I got my first email address in
1992 (vkurup@macc.wisc.edu) and somehow was on a mailing list
announcing the impending release of Mosaic. I remember the text of the
email basically saying that &#8220;This will change the world.&#8221; Once I saw
it, I thought it was cool, but way over-hyped. Who is going to want to
wait for pictures to download over a 14.4K modem? Ridiculous. This is
why you should not take my advice about new trends.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point of the <code>IMG</code> example is to show that HTML standards
have never been &#8220;pure&#8221;, but have always been influenced by the
implementers and the users of the web. The way it should be. HTML5 is
an acknowledgment of that fact.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to be a primary care physician, but switched to being a hospitalist
in 2007. I loved parts about being a PCP, namely the relationship that I
developed with the patient over many years. I miss that. I think PCPs offer
huge value in providing low cost, quality care, especially if they can stay
engaged throughout the hospitalization process. Atul Gawande recently wrote
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/02/100802fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all">a powerful article on the Hospice system</a>. It&#8217;s
worth reading to being to understand the complex issues involved in
end-of-life care, not to mention for the emotional storytelling that is his
strength. But, to me, the unsung hero in that story was Chuck Morris, the
primary care physician, who came in at the proper moment and provided
perspective to the patient that he knew so well, allowing them to make the
sane, yet horribly difficult decision to pursue a palliative path. Reading
that made me miss primary care medicine a little. I perform much more
actual &#8220;medical&#8221; work as a hospitalist than I ever did as a PCP. But, when
I think of the concept of a <em>doctor</em>, in my head, I&#8217;m thinking of a primary
care doc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Braindump time. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve read about clojure in the past few days. I don&#8217;t understand what this means yet, but maybe someday I will:</p>

<blockquote><p>Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure
that calls to Java can avoid reflection.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are multiple languages that target the JVM (besides Java, of
course). It seems that there are 2 classes of languages. Ported languages
such as JRuby and Jython aim to be identical to their base languages
(Ruby &amp; Python). Native languages such as Clojure and Groovy are meant to
target the JVM natively without satisfying any desire to be identical to
another language. Native languages have the advantage that they only have 1
set of libraries to use, so you don&#8217;t get stuck between two languages.</p>

<p>I installed clojure 1.0 from the ubuntu repositories, but promptly
uninstalled it once I found
<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">leiningen</a>. Leiningen is a build
tool for clojure. You can easily create a new project and specify its
dependencies and leiningen will download those dependencies, including a
full version of clojure for each project. You can have 1 project using
leiningen 1.0 and another using version 1.2 sitting right next to it. That
seems smart!</p>

<p>I installed <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Emacs">clojure-mode on
emacs</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, I&#8217;m working my way through the
<a href="http://github.com/relevance/labrepl">labrepl</a> project. It&#8217;s an interactive
tutorial and REPL (read-eval-print-loop) where you can run the examples in
the tutotial.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always important to know how to find help:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(doc blah)</code> gives documentation about blah.</li>
<li><code>(find-doc "blah")</code> searches for documentation.</li>
<li><code>(javadoc blah)</code> opens Java docs in your browser</li>
<li><code>(show java.util.Date)</code> shows method signatures</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s something cool: Maps are associative arrays. Here&#8217;s a simple one:</p>

<pre><code>(def me {:first-name "Vinod", :last-name "Kurup"})
</code></pre>

<p>To get the data, you use the <code>get</code> function, like you would in other languages:</p>

<pre><code>(get me :first-name) -&gt; "Vinod"
</code></pre>

<p>But, maps and keywords are functions as well, so you can do:</p>

<pre><code>(me :first-name) -&gt; "Vinod"
(:last-name me) -&gt; "Kurup"
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use bluetooth to transfer podcasts from my laptop to my Palm Centro. A
Palm Centro is like an iPhone or a Droid, except less <strong>smart</strong>-like and
more <strong>phone</strong>-like. This worked beautifully but broke when I upgraded to
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download">Ubuntu</a> 10.04 (Lucid
Lynx). There are 2 bugs involved. First, the bluetooth daemon
(<code>/usr/sbin/bluetoothd</code>) never gets started. Second, there&#8217;s no easy way to
start the file transfer daemon automatically (<code>/usr/bin/dund</code>). This used
to work automatically, but now it doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve tried to fiddle with <code>udev</code>
rules, but have been unsuccessful. I&#8217;ve reported the 2 bugs, but haven&#8217;t
had any response
yet. <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/589464">(bluetoothd bug)</a>
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/559538">(dund bug)</a></p>

<p>My workaround is a shell script which starts those those daemons if they
are not running:</p>

<h4>vk-bluetooth-start.sh</h4>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

BLUETOOTH='bluetoothd'
DUN='dund'

# first start bluetoothd
if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep $BLUETOOTH &gt; /dev/null
then
    echo "$BLUETOOTH is running."
else
    echo -n "Starting $BLUETOOTH..."
    /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/bluetoothd -u &amp;&gt; /dev/null

<p>And here&#8217;s my script which transfers the files to my phone. It uses
<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/pilot-link">pilot-link</a>, which I had to
compile from source due to a
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pilot-link/+bug/592916">bug in the way that the Ubuntu version addresses large SD cards</a>. This
should be fixed in the next version of Ubuntu.</p>

<h4>vk-transfer-podcasts.sh</h4>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

output=$(pilot-xfer -p net:any -D /Kingston/AUDIO -i *.mp3 2&gt;&amp;1)
errors=$(echo $output | grep -c "ERROR:")

if [ $errors -gt 0 ] ; then
    echo "failure (count: $errors)"
    echo $output
else
    echo -n "success, removing files from laptop..."
    /bin/rm -I $HOME/*.mp3
    echo "done."
fi
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why I use a slow protocol like bluetooth to transfer
large files to an SD card, rather than just ejecting the SD card and
inserting it into the laptop, well&#8230; you haven&#8217;t tried to access the SD
card on a Palm Centro. #paininthe&amp;<sup>@!</sup></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last night shift was a little less busy than most, so I forced myself to pick something about each patient I admitted and look it up. I tend to do this anyway, but I never keep notes or write about it. Here&#8217;s what I wrote about that night:</p>

<h3>Does Buspar (buspirone) need to be tapered?</h3>

<p>Answer: No. The full report on Micromedex was a little conflicting, because it stated that there may be some withdrawal symptoms from Buspar, but this quote in the same profile suggests otherwise:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data suggest that buspirone does not cause physical dependence and as such, no withdrawal effects have been noted (Rickels et al, 1988a; Tyrer et al, 1985; Cole et al, 1982).</p></blockquote>

<h3>Staging COPD</h3>

<p>I always forget the cutoffs for the stages of COPD. There are 2 different guidleines - GOLD and ATS/ARS, but fortunately they are almost identical:</p>

<p>Patients need to have an FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70. Staging is then based on the FEV1.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage I (Mild): FEV1 > 80% predicted</li>
<li>Stage II (Moderate): FEV1 50-80% predicted</li>
<li>Stage III (Severe): FEV1 30-50% predicted</li>
<li>Stage IV: (Very Severe): FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted, or &lt; 50% with signs of chronic respiratory failure</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to determine calorie level of ADA diet?</h3>

<p>We always put diabetic patients on an ADA diet and I choose the calorie level by gestalt. I figured there must be some formula to calculate the calorie level based on the patient&#8217;s weight. Looking it up, I found a different answer altogether. The ADA no longer recommends an ADA diet in the hospital. Instead, they recommend a consistent-carbohydrate diet. In long-term care facilities (i.e. nursing homes), they go a step further and recommend a &#8216;Regular&#8217; diet with consistency in the amount and timing of carbohydrate. They specifically state that there is no evidence to support the classic &#8216;No concentrated sweets&#8217; diet. These guidelines are from 2007, but they obviously have not been widely disseminated yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is recommended that the term “ADA diet” no longer be used, since the ADA no longer endorses a single nutrition prescription or percentages of macronutrients.</p></blockquote>
