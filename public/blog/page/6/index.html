<a href="http://futuredocsblog.com/2010/10/20/preparing-for-attending-rounds-some-things-don%E2%80%99t-change/">guide to medical student oral
presentations</a>,
so I thought I&#8217;d share the cheat sheet that I give to the medical
students and PA students when I start each teaching block. As she
mentioned, presentations always have to be tailored to the listener,
and each attending is different, so you&#8217;ll see minor differences in
what I recommend.</p>

<p>To me, the most important aspects are organization and preparation. I
don&#8217;t like to have the sense that the student is &#8220;winging it&#8221;. Prepare
for each presentation like you are preparing to give a talk to a
roomful of people. For me, that meant practicing the presentation at
home and with the residents before I presented to an attending.</p>

<p>I also give each student a printed copy of the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/medclerk/drupal/pages/Oral-Presentation-Guidelines">guidelines posted at
the University of Washington&#8217;s medical education
site</a>. It
goes into more detail about all of these issues. My favorite portion
is the graph that they present, which I&#8217;ll reproduce here:</p>

<p><img src="/images/uwash-med-student-presentation.png" title="Skip
 the Boring Stuff" alt="Listener Attention" /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1XjKZsHu_Q54rL9EwtPtS9via-hEs67H2fRDEs8eHAZc">printable copy of my cheat sheet</a>.</p>

<h3>Initial Presentation:</h3>

<p><strong>CC/ID</strong></p>

<p>Be Brief. Gets the listener primed for what type of case is going to be presented.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a 33 year old male with a history of asthma who presents with a chief complaint of dyspnea.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>HPI</strong></p>

<p>This is the meat of the presentation. Pretend that you&#8217;re telling the
patient&#8217;s story to a friend. How much information would they need to
really understand what the patient is going through? Think about it
from the patient&#8217;s perspective. What was the tipping point that made
them seek medical attention? What have they tried to make things
better? Stay consistent in your timeline. I like to start at the last
point that the patient was completely well. In patients with chronic
illness, that is hard, so you may have to start at the last time that
they were &#8220;relatively&#8221; well.</p>

<blockquote><p>He was completely well (or &#8220;in his usual state of health&#8221; for chronically ill patients) until 5 days ago, when he noticed feeling short of breath after walking 300 feet to his mailbox. Over the course of the next 5 days, his dyspnea worsened to the point that he was short of breath at rest. He tried taking his albuterol inhaler, but felt no relief. Etc…</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s also useful to split the HPI into 2 distinct sections. The first
part is the patient&#8217;s story, as described above. In the second part,
you take that story and decide what a reasonable differential
diagnosis list would be after listening to the first part. Then
provide the listener with appropriate ROS and PMH items to help them
rule those other diagnoses out.</p>

<p><strong>PMH</strong></p>

<p>You may have mentioned a few of these in the CC, but repeat them
here. For most conditions, just list the diagnosis, but if it has
particular pertinence to the HPI, then provide more detail. Also, try
to give some indication of the severity of the condition for certain
conditions: CHF (EF), DM (A1C), COPD (FEV1).</p>

<blockquote><p>Past medical history includes Asthma. He has been hospitalized twice in the past year, and required mechanical ventilation in April. He also has hypertension and allergic rhinitis.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Meds</strong></p>

<p>List meds like a robot :-) Include doses if they are important. You&#8217;ll
learn the importance of doses with experience. In general, if the med
is related to the HPI, I want to know the dose. You can&#8217;t go wrong by
just giving me the dose on each med. Just run through them quickly</p>

<p><strong>FH/SH/ROS</strong></p>

<p>You should obviously have done these portions of the interview, but if
 they were important, I would have wanted to hear about it in the
 HPI. (Pt lives in a nursing home… Pt smokes… etc.) It&#8217;s OK to go over
 it quickly, but probably better to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>FH/SH/ROS is unremarkable aside from what was presented in HPI</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Exam</strong></p>

<p>List the VS: Temp/HR/BP/RR/O2 sat. Then provide an overall impression:</p>

<blockquote><p>In general, the patient appears tired and seemed to be in mild respiratory distress.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pertinent negatives and significant positives only:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lung exam was remarkable for diffuse expiratory wheezes with accessory muscle use. Cardiac exam confirmed tachycardia. There was no lower extremity edema and the remainder of the complete physical exam was normal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Be completely objective. Avoid downplaying your exam skills. It&#8217;s OK
to get things wrong – it&#8217;s often the best way to learn. Avoid patient
interpretations here.</p>

<p><strong>Labs/Xray/EKG/Procedures</strong></p>

<p>If it&#8217;s all normal, OK to say it&#8217;s all normal, but if any are
abnormal, I like to hear each value in that group.</p>

<p><strong>ER course</strong></p>

<p>Brief sentence on what happened in the ER before you saw the patient.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment/Plan</strong></p>

<p>Second juicy part of the presentation. Identify each problem and go
one by one. Put the most pressing issue first. If the diagnosis is in
question, give me a differential diagnosis and let me know what we&#8217;re
doing to rule out items on the differential. If the diagnosis is
relatively certain, present me with various therapeutic options and
the reason why you chose the one you did.</p>

<p>Think about &#8220;goals of care&#8221;, if appropriate</p>

<p>Always mention disposition. What are we looking for before the patient
can be discharged? In some cases, this will be nebulous, but at least
mention it. &#8220;Disposition is unclear at this point because of X&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Overnight course</strong></p>

<p>What happened after you put your plan in place? Brief status report on
how patient is doing today.</p>

<h3>Subsequent Day Presentations:</h3>

<p><strong>1 line about patient</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ms Jones is our 87 year old woman here with an aspiration pneumonia</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Overnight course</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since yesterday&#8217;s rounds, she has had a speech evaluation and they recommended a video swallow study. She had one temperature spike to 38.5 degrees and blood cultures were drawn. She appears to more comfortable this morning, though she is still confused.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Exam</strong>: Vitals, superquick exam describing pertinents only</p>

<p><strong>Labs</strong>: Any new labs that came back since we met for rounds yesterday.</p>

<p><strong>Plan for today</strong>: Go by problem again.</p>

<blockquote><p>Problem 1: aspiration pneumonia, she&#8217;s on D3 of Zosyn and we will continue to followup cultures. Overall she seems improved, but we&#8217;ll have to continue to monitor her mental status and oxygenation for further improvement. Problem 2: Altered mental status: This is almost certainly due to her pneumonia, but if it does not improve by tomorrow, we may consider other etiologies. At that point, repeat labs, EKG, and head CT may be indicated.  &#8230; Problem 53: Disposition &#8230;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aspirin is one of those wonder drugs - simple, cheap and effective
versus so many deadly diseases. We know that aspirin prevents heart
attacks and strokes, especially if you&#8217;ve had one before. There is
also some data that it prevents colon cancers, but it was thought that
this effect was only seen when using high doses of aspirin. The
downside of aspirin is that it increases your risk of bleeding,
especially gastrointestinal bleeding (usually from stomach
ulcers). Using <em>high</em> doses of aspirin tends to increase the bleeding
risk so much that it offsets any benefits.</p>

<p>When someone has had a stroke or heart attack, using aspirin is a
no-brainer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease#Secondary_prevention">secondary
prevention</a>). The
question is when to start aspirin in patients who have never had a bad
event (<a href="http://www.enotes.com/public-health-encyclopedia/primary-prevention">primary
prevention</a>). We
used to be much more liberal about recommending aspirin for primary
prevention, but there haven&#8217;t been many studies which have supported
the practice. The current guidelines state to consider starting
aspirin for primary prevention in men at age 45 and women at age 55,
if their risk of vascular disease outweighs their risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding. That&#8217;s a wishy-washy way of saying &#8220;Leave
it up to your gut.&#8221; (No pun intended)</p>

<p>I decided to write about this because I saw a recent <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144578?dopt=Abstract">study showing
decreased deaths from cancer in aspirin
users</a>,
even at <strong>low</strong> doses. Overall cancer rates were 20% lower and
gastrointestinal cancer rates were 35% lower than in people who didn&#8217;t
use aspirin. These data come from 2 meta-analyses of retrospective
studies, which tend to be a relatively weak type of study. Prospective
studies are much better, but these numbers strike me as significant.</p>

<p>Given this new data, I would strongly favor using aspirin in most
people once they hit those age cutoffs (45 &amp; 55), which for me is
pretty soon. Calculate your <a href="http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp">cardiovascular
risk</a>. If your risk
is any more than 10% or so, I would recommend taking an aspirin daily,
possibly even if it&#8217;s lower. The reasons that I would recommend not
taking an aspirin are if you have frequent stomach ulcers, previous
severe bleeding, or if you&#8217;re taking blood thinners or high doses of
NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen). Here&#8217;s a nice <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/cvd/aspprovider.htm">fact
sheet</a> that summarizes
what I&#8217;ve just rambled about (Wish I had seen that before I wrote all
this!)</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Don&#8217;t take medical advice from the internet. Show this to
your doctor so they can tell you what a quack I am.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I take it back. I was upset, OK? Never tweet when you&#8217;re upset. I&#8217;m
writing this blog post to make up for it. See, a whole blog post. That
definitely outweighs a tweet, right?</p>

<p>Last week, my 1996 Altima died. The starter seemed to be firing, but
the engine never turned over. We tried jumping it, but that didn&#8217;t
work. I called a tow truck and then
<a href="http://twitter.com/vkurup/status/31553126746038272">tweeted</a> about
how upset I was with the universe.</p>

<blockquote><p>hey universe, I would love to go a full 6 months without a car dying. #kthxbye</p></blockquote>

<p>Snarky, huh? Even stuck the childish #kthxbye in there. Blaming the
universe is kinda like getting upset with God, in a scientist&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>But, it&#8217;s been a week now, and I&#8217;ve had time to think about it and I
now realize how lucky I am. Not just in general, because that&#8217;s
certainly true and something that I remember every time I come home
and see my beautiful wife and kids. But, how lucky I am that my car
died. Let&#8217;s look at some details. The car was in our neighborhood&#8217;s
parking lot when it died. I was coming home from work and saw Mala and
the kids playing at the playground, so I pulled into the parking lot
and played with them for a while. When we got in the car to go home,
the car wouldn&#8217;t start. The car was dead in a parking lot, in a safe
neighborhood, walking distance from our house. Just think of all the
other places that it could&#8217;ve died. How lucky that it died in that
location, where it was easy for a tow truck to access, where it was
not in the way of traffic, where it was safe, and most importantly,
where it was easy for everyone to get home. The kids enjoyed just
about every moment of the experience (just like Kavi did when our RAV4
died in much more stressful circumstances in NYC last fall).</p>

<p>The tow truck came, did a little testing and then dutifully towed the
car to my mechanic and dropped the key in their dropbox. They found a
distributor filled with oil and some worn out spark plugs. The fixes
weren&#8217;t cheap, but they weren&#8217;t too expensive (using rebuilt
parts). I was driving again about 48 hours after the car died and life
is back to normal now. Again, how lucky is that?</p>

<p>I was also thinking about the previous time that the Altima died. I
remember writing this affirmation in my journal, while I was waiting
for the tow truck back in September 2008:</p>

<blockquote><p>Late entry. This was written on the day that the Nissan&#8217;s battery
died. Everything will be fine. I will find out later how this will
be a blessing in disguise. This car will give us another 2-3 years
of great service.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s now been 2 and a half years since then and the car has been
steady and reliable throughout that time. How lucky can a guy get?
The Nissan is pushing 140,000 miles and it&#8217;s not the most convenient
car with the 2 carseats taking up the whole back seat, so I think it&#8217;s
time for a new car, but how lucky that I have the luxury of taking my
time to find one?</p>

<p>So, Thank you Universe! I look forward to the next lesson that you&#8217;ve
got in store for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read this book in 2005, but never posted this review. So here it
is&#8230;</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671671642?ie=UTF8&tag=vinodkurupshomep&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0671671642">Growing a Business</a> by Paul Hawken</h2>

<p>This is an honest and practical guide to running a business. I don&#8217;t
remember where I first heard about this book. Maybe <a href="http://pinds.com">Lars</a>?</p>

<p>It was written in 1987. Hawken talks about building a business. It&#8217;s
often portrayed as a heroic or glamorous endeavor, but really it&#8217;s
not. It&#8217;s a lot of hard work, but also a lot of common sense. He spends a
chapter talking about a quality that you need to be successful in your own
business. He calls it Tradeskill.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like intuition, for business. He says its something you can&#8217;t acquire
easily, except perhaps in childhood. People that were drawn into business
activities at a young age have it. Those that weren&#8217;t, don&#8217;t. And no amount
of book-smarts can make up for the lack of Tradeskill. If you&#8217;re not
comfortable haggling in a flea market, you should think twice about going
into business. Instead, he recommends dipping your feet in the water,
without starting a business yourself. Take a part time job in a business
that you&#8217;re interested in and try to take on as many roles as possible in
that business.</p>

<p>Another theme in his book is the wisdom of growing slowly. Having too much
money while starting a business is worse than no having enough. It&#8217;s
something I read a lot now (Arsdigita, Paul Graham, 37Signals), but it&#8217;s
interesting to see it written way back when as well.</p>

<h3>Things I learned from this book</h3>

<h2>It&#8217;s probably not for me</h2>

<p>Starting your own business is not for everyone. It takes a temperament that
isn&#8217;t easily learned. I don&#8217;t think I have Tradeskill. I&#8217;m not going to let
that stop me from learning about business, but I&#8217;m going to be a little
more thorough in my planning and preparation if I ever do it.</p>

<h2>The 5-15 report is a good idea</h2>

<p>He mentions something called a 5-15 report. it&#8217;s a report that every
employee in a company should have to write <strong>every</strong> week. It should take
less than 15 minutes to write and less than 5 minutes to read. Part I is a
progress report for the week, Part II is a report on the morale of the
department and Part III is one idea to make the company better. I like the
idea of a weekly low-commitment progress report.</p>

<h2>Overstaffing is the root of all evil</h2>

<p>A major problem of big business is over-staffing. Once an employee
learns that their work is redundant, or requires little effort, they
realize their job is expendable and that they must spend all their
time preserving their job - through hijacking credit, office politics,
etc. The basic result is that <strong>people hoard information</strong>. Information
that, if freely disseminated, would allow the company to function
better. If I have useful information that other employees don&#8217;t have,
then I am valuable. Understaffed companies (start-ups) work in the
opposite way. I have enough work as it is, so I&#8217;m happy to share
information with you, because perhaps it will allow you to help me out
with my workload. The company becomes more efficient. I see this
effect of over-staffing where I work (although I didn&#8217;t recognize it
as such until reading this book)</p>

<h3>random quotes / concepts from the book</h3>

<p>Flat management/employee structures are good. Trust the people you work with and
give them wide latitude.</p>

<p>Problems are opportunities - dive into them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good business has interesting problems. A bad business has boring ones.&#8221; (p. 39)</p>

<p>Have a partner. You shouldn&#8217;t ever think of going it alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being in business is not about making money. It is a way to become who you are.&#8221; (p. 19)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had my first full phone conversation with Kavi today. I was about to
leave work, so I called home to let Mala know that I was on my way
home. (For the second time&#8230; I got called back to help in the ER on
my first attempt, but that&#8217;s another story). When the phone rang, Kavi
picked up the phone. &#8220;Hi Daddy, when are you coming home?&#8221; I told him
that I was leaving now and that I&#8217;d be home in half an hour. &#8220;OK
Daddy. Bye!&#8221; <em>Click</em></p>

<p>Hopefully, he gave the message to Mala :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you get this error message:</p>

<pre><code>Can't exec "autopoint": No such file or directory at /usr/share/autoconf/Autom4te/FileUtils.pm
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you need to install autopoint:</p>

<pre><code>sudo aptitude install autopoint
</code></pre>

<p>I ran into this while building
<a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger">ledger</a> today and had never
needed to do that before. The error that <code>acprep</code> provides is even
more cryptic:</p>

<pre><code>Automatically preparing build ... Warning: autoreconf failed
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I ran <code>autogen.sh</code> and the autpoint error showed up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another piece of advice that I&#8217;ve heard over and over again is to make
things easier. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/09/how-to-be-dispensable-and-why-you-should-document-and-automate-yourself-out-of-a-job/">Automate!</a>
In that vein, I learned a little elisp in order to make it easier to
create a new blog post. I create my posts in emacs, but I often cut
and paste the YAML header from a previous post, which is tedious and
time-consuming. Here is my new posting function:</p>

<pre><code>(defun vk-blogpost (title)
  "Create a new blog post."
  (interactive "sPost Title: ")
  (let ((slug (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" (downcase title))))
    (find-file (concat "~/web/kurup.org/_posts/"
                       (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")
                       "-" slug ".markdown"))
    (insert "---\n")
    (insert "date: " (format-time-string "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S") "\n")
    (insert "layout: post\n")
    (insert "title: " title "\n")
    (insert "categories: \n")
    (insert "---\n\n")))
</code></pre>

<p>After asking me for a title, it creates a new file and massages the
title to create a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(web_publishing">slug</a>). It
automatically enters the date of the post, both in the filename and
in the YAML header. This took me about an hour to write, mostly in
googling elisp commands. Hopefully, it will save time in the long run,
but even if it doesn&#8217;t, it was fun to write :-)</p>

<p>Any feedback on my primitive elisp would be appreciated!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found this <a href="http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=195">great article on
writing</a> by Sebastian
Marshall. His basic advice boils down to &#8220;just do it!&#8221;, but he makes
some interesting points along the way. I had never heard of the
Equal-Odds rule. Read more details at his blog, but basically, in
order to do great work, you have to do a lot of &#8220;not-great&#8221; work. No
one just does great work. So, let go and just write. The great stuff
will float to the top.</p>

<p>Commit to doing it every day, no matter what. I don&#8217;t know how many
times I&#8217;ve heard this, yet I still don&#8217;t do it. I guess it&#8217;s like I
tell my smokers who tell me they&#8217;ve tried to quit so many times. Each
quit attempt is preparation for the time that you really quit. You
never know when it&#8217;s going to stick, so just keep trying.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I accepted that I&#8217;m going to be judged. I don&#8217;t love it, but I
accepted it.</em>&#8221; This is the hardest part for me. My ego is fragile, but
oh well. The benefits are worth the risks.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Try to think of each visitor as an honored guest.</em>&#8221; I like that. My
site gets minimal traffic, but that&#8217;s not zero. And I actually know
some of the people that read &#8230; don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t embarrass them
by naming names. The bottom line is that my whole purpose is to
improve the lives of others, in whatever small way possible. To think
that <strong>anyone</strong> is spending their precious time reading this is an honor
to me.</p>

<p>I may never be the prolific writer that I envision myself being, but
it can&#8217;t hurt to keep trying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.russfeingold.org/">Russ Feingold</a> lost his U.S. Senate
race. I haven&#8217;t been following Wisconsin politics since I left 14
years ago, but this makes me sad. The last time that I really cared
about the U.S. political landscape was 1992. I was 21 and in college
at the University of Wisconsin and was voting for the first time. Bill
Clinton was generating excitement, especially on college campuses, but
I was more interested in Russ Feingold&#8217;s campaign. He was a no-name
state senator, running against incumbent Bob Kasten. He seemed honest,
funny and down-to-earth. He painted his campaign promises on his
garage door so that everyone would be able to hold him to them. I
remember people saying that if he won, he&#8217;d change. The amazing thing
is that he didn&#8217;t. In 3 terms in the Senate, he has continued to stay
humble, while also crossing the aisle at times and voting against
popular, but misguided policies like the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>After the 1992 election, I remember thinking that real change was
coming. I know that the main reason that I was so excited in 1992 was
because it was my first time being a part of the political process. Of
course, as we all know, not much ever changes in U.S. politics. I&#8217;ve
come to realize and accept that. Russ Feingold was an exception and
seeing him lose, despite having lived up to his high standards, makes
me sad.</p>
