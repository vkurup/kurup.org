  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a few friends over tonight for our first little get-together in our house. Mala made homemade pizza and cake. I provided moral support :-) Everyone had a great time. There were 4 little kiddos and 1 infant, which made for some craziness, but everyone left in good health. It&#8217;s a treat to watch Kavi interact with other kids. He&#8217;s a real observer. He sits back and watches what everyone is doing. While the other kids were running like crazy around the house, Kavi was content to sit on the carpet and watch them scream. He was pretty tired since he had taken an early nap, so maybe that was part of it. He also seemed happy to watch the other kids play with all of his toys. I mean, sometimes he would try to grab a toy that another kid was playing with, but for the most part, he didn&#8217;t seem to care. When we finally cleaned up and got him ready for bed, it was nearly 10 PM. He fell asleep while I was singing a lullaby to him. He woke up for a minute when I put him down, but that was it. He was tired!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, I know it&#8217;s been almost a year since I updated this blog, but rest assured that I&#8217;m still alive and kicking. The observant among you will notice that the design of the blog has changed. The even more observant will notice that huge swaths of content are now missing. Things like my photo albums, my running log, old comments, and Kavi&#8217;s little site are now gone. They may make a reappearance someday, especially if I get prodded sufficiently. I have my old site running locally on my laptop, but I&#8217;m too lazy to bring it all back right now.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re just interested in pics of Kavi (and I know that&#8217;s most of you), go visit <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/vvkurup">my Picasa photo album</a>.</p>

<p>Cathy Sarisky, who had so kindly hosted kurup.org for a few years now, has decided to exit the web hosting business. I took the opportunity to scale down my web operations a bit. This blog is now powered by <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> instead of <a href="http://www.openacs.org">OpenACS</a>. I&#8217;m hoping that &#8220;outsourcing&#8221; the tech stuff to WordPress will allow me to focus more on writing stuff, rather than tweaking settings. Hold me to it! I&#8217;ve stolen the design for this blog from <a href="http://diveintomark.org">diveintomark</a>. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed his writing and his design sense. I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind.</p>

<p>So much has changed since my last post. Kavi has just continued to grow and amaze us. I know for a fact that he is the most adorable little boy in the universe. He&#8217;s gotten even more adorable now that he sleeps through the night (as of the past month!). We&#8217;ve moved into a house for the first time in our adult lives. We are now residents of Chapel Hill, NC. We&#8217;re living the American Dream. I&#8217;m going to skip right over the whole purchase process which was more nightmarish than it should have been thanks to some very difficult sellers. Since moving in, we&#8217;ve replaced a missing toilet tank, shampooed carpets, changed locks, and hired painters, landscapers, electricians, pest control people, gutter cleaners and house cleaners. Almost makes you want to move back into an apartment. :-)</p>

<p>I started work as a hospitalist last September, and I&#8217;m starting to get into a groove now. It was quite a shock to switch from outpatient, academic practice to inpatient, private practice. At times, I still feel like a resident, but for the most part, I find this job to be much more rewarding intellectually and spiritually. It&#8217;s more exhausting than I thought it would be, though. I can&#8217;t see myself working this kind of schedule for the rest of my life. So, as always, I&#8217;m still trying to figure out exactly what I want to do when I grow up.</p>

<p>Well, enough rambling for my first post back. Hope to speak to y&#8217;all soon (That&#8217;s the southerner in me now!)</p>

Vinod, congratulations to you and your wife. Having just celebrated my
son&#8217;s 2nd birthday last weekend, I&#8217;m pretty sure there will be more
Kavi chronicles coming up.

Congratulations Vinu and Mala. Kavi is a really nice name&#8230;I like
it. His big cousins were very excited to hear the news. I&#8217;m not sure
if Sunny was happy or sad to give up the title of youngest
grandchild. :)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s also get caught up with my investments. I last updated in May 2006 when I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=STS">STS</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JAX">JAX</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EEI">EEI</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KEYN">KEYN</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RSC">RSC</a>.</p>

<p>At my next quarterly evaluation in August 2006, I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DSWL">DSWL</a> at a loss of 16.7% because I had held it for 2 years and it no longer met my criteria for a stock I would want to buy. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SYPR">SYPR</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BSET">BSET</a>.</p>

<p>In November 2006, I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SEMI.PK">SEMI</a> because it reported a negative quarter on top of negative trailing 12 month earnings. I sold it at $3.02, for a 42.8% loss, just a few days before <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SEMI.PK">SEMI</a> announced that it was filing for bankruptcy and dropped to $0.28. Sometimes you get lucky. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SGC">SGC</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IAL">IAL</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FLXS">FLXS</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CULS">CULS</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PRCP">PRCP</a>, and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PARL">PARL</a>.</p>

<p>In February of 2007, I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KEYN">KEYN</a> for a 18.9% gain and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SYPR">SYPR</a> for a 22% loss because both reported a negative quarter on top of 12 month negative earnings. I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SRT">SRT</a> for a 16.2% loss because it was such a small portion of my portfolio and it didn&#8217;t meet my buy criteria. I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBR">COBR</a> for a 23.9% gain and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PATK">PATK</a> for a 16.7% gain because I&#8217;d held both for 2 years, but they no longer met my buy criteria. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AIRT">AIRT</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HDNG">HDNG</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AWX">AWX</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CAV">CAV</a>, and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JCTCF">JCTCF</a>.</p>

<p>In April/May 2007, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IAL">IAL</a> got bought out for a 16.8% gain and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BL">BL</a> got bought out for a 11.0% gain. I sold <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JCS">JCS</a> for a 21.4% gain because they had fallen behind multiple quarters in their filings. I bought <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PMRY">PMRY</a>, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=POP">POP</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HOOK">HOOK</a>. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=POP">POP</a> dropped about 40% on the day that I bought it. Sometimes you get unlucky.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how the rest of my portfolio is doing as of May 31st, 2007.</p>

<p><b>Congratulations</b></p>
<p>
Vinod!!! I have no idea how you have time for all of this stuff (plus reading books), but I have two things to say:
</p>
<p>
1. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW BABY! You must be so proud and so
happy. I always knew that sweet Mala, who loves the Gilmore Girls and
Peanut Butter Cup ice cream, is really a warrior on the inside and
could tough out a delivery that would send me to the morphine drip.
</p>
<p>
2. On a side note, I think the large caps are back man! In this world
of private equity money and uber-duber liquidity, go large baby.

<ul>
<li>Mala&#8217;s pregnancy is going well, at least from the husband&#8217;s point of view. She&#8217;s due June 15th.</li>
<li>We drove to Orlando for my CME conference because Delta cancelled our flight. It turned out to be a nice thing because we got to see Puja, Ethan and Loki on the way down and we got to stop in Charleston, SC on the way back.</li>
<li>Not to be outdone by Delta, Northwest cancelled my flight to Minneapolis. For those scoring at home, that&#8217;s 2 consecutive flights cancelled due to &#8220;weather&#8221;</li>
<li>Our job search came down to the wire and, in a difficult decision, we chose North Carolina. I&#8217;ll be working as a hospitalist at <a href="http://www.durhamregional.org/">Durham Regional Hospital</a> (associated with Duke University) and Mala will be at the <a href="http://pediatrics.med.unc.edu/div/endocrin/default.htm">University of North Carolina</a>.</li>
<li>We went to Baltimore for Mala&#8217;s 10 year Hopkins Reunion. I got to see the campus where Mala went to college and we even took in a lacrosse game.</li>
<li>My brother <a href="http://www2.kurup.net/">Manu started to blog</a>. Yes, this is a thinly veiled jab to get him to update again.</li>
<li>Puja and Farah threw a wonderful little baby shower for us. It was a lot of fun (yes, I just said that a baby shower was a lot of fun)</li>
<li>I just got back from a quick trip to North Carolina to find an apartment. We&#8217;ll be staying at a place called Southpoint Village, assuming that it gets built in time. Everyone please cross your fingers.</li>
<li>My parents have moved to Dallas, TX, which means that the house I grew up with will be sold. It didn&#8217;t hit me until just now, but I&#8217;ll probably never see the inside of that house again.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re both beginning to wind down at our current jobs. Mala&#8217;s fellowship ends in June and my last day is July 10th. We&#8217;ll move to NC at some point after that.</li>
<li>They finally turned the A/C on in the building here, which is really nice when the weather is 90+ and your wife is pregnant :)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did something yesterday that I haven&#8217;t done before. I took a ride on the subway from one end all the way to the other end. I took the D train from 205th street in the Bronx to Coney Island/Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn, passing through Manhattan on the way. Left at 6:04 AM and arrived at 7:46 AM, just in time to make it to the start of the Brooklyn Half Marathon. It was a beautiful day to run.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only been running for a few weeks since taking a &#8220;long&#8221; time off,
so I was happy with my 2:00:50 finish.</p>

I had a short stab at getting back into sport after a lengthy break
last month, but it didn&#8217;t last too long ;)

I finished it on my marathon subway rides yesterday. It&#8217;s partly a voyeuristic look into how people do or don&#8217;t survive when bad things happen. This part is pure storytelling and who doesn&#8217;t love a good story? At times, the outdoorsy jargon made it hard for me to follow what exactly was going on, but on the whole I was sucked in, turning pages to see what happened to our poor characters.</p>

<p>The other part is an analysis of why one person survives and another seemingly more equipped, more experienced person succumbs. There is, of course, no hard answer and luck is a huge component, but some common characteristics do emerge. Survivors tend to remain calm, come to terms with their likely mortality, yet continue to strive against it by adapting to their new situations as best as possible. On the other hand, &#8220;The Rambo types are the first to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Parts of Deep Survival made me wonder if I should ever go hiking in the woods ever again. His description of seemingly innocent trips gone horribly bad can scare you. But (and the author makes this clear), this is NOT the point. Life is about enjoying beauty and constantly extending your abilities. It&#8217;s just critical to understand that nature is not a supervised playground and that there are always real dangers, no matter how <em>simple</em> the excursion. Knowing that fact, being properly outfitted and prepared, and most importantly, being aware of your surroundings and instincts will decrease your risk. And with risk managed properly, the reward-to-risk ratio of immersing yourself in nature <strong>easily</strong> beats out staying secure in your daily life, which is by no means risk-free either.</p>

<p>So check out Deep Survival if you like a good story and if you want to learn a little more about what gives you the best chances of surviving a bad event.</p>
