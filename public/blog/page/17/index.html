If you&#8217;re a keen follower of this site, you&#8217;ll have noticed the little box in the upper left hand corner announcing my <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding">wedding to Mala</a>. We got married a few months back and it was documented in photos by <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17012">friends, family</a> and even <a href="http://kurup.org/wedding/photo-album/album?album_id=17010">an official photographer</a>. (Time wasting warning: There are 500 pictures from friends and family, 1200+ proofs from our photographer).</p>

<p>My brother Manoj created a touching slide show which had our guests laughing and Mala and I cringeing. That hasn&#8217;t made it to the website yet, but negotiations with the concerned parties are in progress (&#8220;C&#8217;mon Mala, it&#8217;s not that embarrassing!&#8221;). We can&#8217;t thank enough the people who made our wedding day magical. It was, without question, the happiest day of my life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A-ha! This <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/list-indent.html">article by Eric Meyer</a> explains why &lt;ul> and &lt;ol>&#8217;s can appear differently in MSIE and Mozilla browsers. Both indent the list items, but MSIE does so by setting the padding to 2.5 em, while Mozilla does so by setting the margin to 2.5 em. These are on the &lt;ul> and &lt;ol> selectors, not the &lt;li>. So, in order to get consistent display on both browsers, you need to set both padding-left and margin-left to whatever you want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The marathon is tomorrow. I can&#8217;t wait, but I&#8217;m pretty nervous. I really want to break 5 hours this time. You can track me online at <a href="http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/results/index.php">the NY Marathon site</a>. I&#8217;ll be runner number 27072.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2005-11-14</strong>:</p>

<p>I finished in 4:28:09 (chip time). I&#8217;m very happy with my time and the whole experience. Running down 4th avenue in Brooklyn was crowded, but just breathtaking. You could see a river of people for what seemed like miles ahead. I kept it slow through the first 20 miles and had hoped to turn it on at the end, but there was nothing left to turn on. So, I just enjoyed the sights and sounds. Thanks to my vocal supporters at the 18 (Mala, Milla and Ben) and 22 (Dave and Theresa, et. al.) mile marks. You guys kept me going. Here&#8217;s a couple pics from the <a href="http://brightroom.com">brightroom</a> site.</p>

It actually took me 8 minutes to get to the start line, so my &#8220;chip&#8221;
time was 4:28:09, which is about 40 minutes faster than my previous
marathons. Good enough that I can retire from the sport, I think :-)

Hey Vin, way to go, not a bad time for an old man like yourself.  When
next year&#8217;s marathon rolls around you&#8217;ll be 35, you just might be
ready for retirement :P.  You also took a better picture this year as
opposed to last year&#8217;s photo.  Again way to go.  Andy

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://kurup.org/blog/2005/08/01/quarterly-sells">Andy asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey Vin, what do you think of SBG (Sinclair Broadcast Group) Its the company that owns Channels 18 and 24(my employer). Andy</p></blockquote>

<p>I took a quick look at SBGI and would probably avoid it. The first place I always look is the market cap. At 700 million, it&#8217;s a little bigger than the companies I&#8217;m investing in. The second place I look is the balance sheet and SBGI&#8217;s scares me. It has a current ratio less than 2 (current assets divided by current liabilities). This means that they don&#8217;t have much leeway in paying off bills due in the next year in a worst-case scenario. More than half of their assets are intangible assets (goodwill, etc). Basically, these are considered assets in an accounting sense, but aren&#8217;t tangible. Sometimes intangible assets are very valuable (for example, Coke&#8217;s brand name), but usually they aren&#8217;t. They also have a huge amount of debt which, although common in the broadcast industry, makes them riskier. This combination of factors makes their tangible book value negative. That means that if the company goes under for any reason, the chances of stockholders getting anything is unlikely.</p>

<p>Basically, I look for small companies (less than 500 million market cap), with strong balance sheets, priced cheap (P/B less than 1.5) and with improving fundamentals. This doesn&#8217;t mean that SBGI won&#8217;t do well. It might, but it doesn&#8217;t fit into my strategy.</p>

Thanks for checking it out, not that I was planning on investing I got

Still undervalued, but its fundamentals aren&#8217;t as promising as they were a year ago. They&#8217;ve taken on an acquisition which seems a little outside their circle of competence. They&#8217;re a golf clothing company and they bought a hat company specializing in college sports and NASCAR. Doesn&#8217;t quite fit. Share count is increasing, no free cash flow, taking on more debt, return on assets decreasing, CFO left. I claim failure on this one. |</td>

<td> It&#8217;s hard to sell a stock that has been on such a run, but it&#8217;s even harder to watch a stock tank when you knew you should have sold. Of course, I have no way of knowing if BMHC will tank, but I do know that it doesn&#8217;t meet my criteria for a stock in my portfolio. I bought this last year because I noticed that it had a PE ratio &lt; 10, a P/B ratio near 1, and it was paying a dividend. The P/B ratio is now over 3, so it&#8217;s no longer such a great value. It&#8217;s benefitted from the great housing market nationwide, but I don&#8217;t think that can last forever. Again, BMHC may go up from here, but that&#8217;s OK because I&#8217;m only interested in owning stocks that fit into my philosophy - small and cheap. |</td>

They&#8217;re hiring 2 big-4 accounting firms to help with compliance, in addition to another auditor for their general financial statements.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cobra Industries (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBR">COBR</a>) announced their second quarter results today. I bought COBR in February 2005 because they seemed really undervalued (based on Price/Book and Price/Earnings ratios). They make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Band">CB radios</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_way_radio">2-way radios</a>, radar detectors, and are starting to make handheld GPS devices. Cobra owns around 60% of the CB radio market, 20% of the 2-way radio market and 60% of the radar-detector market. They&#8217;ve just started in the GPS market and their major product, the NavOne 3000, seems like a flop so far.</p>

<p>This quarter, their revenue and earning were way up and the stock price jumped 25% today (Woo hoo!). I listened to the conference call and here are my thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Revenue up 34%, especially from Radio Shack and Walmart. Demand seems good through the rest of this year.</li>
<li>Gross margin was down slightly because some retailers were experiencing high demand and were running out of product, so they had to specially ship extra inventory, at a higher freight cost. Margins should return next quarter.</li>
<li>Current GPS device (<a href="http://www.cobraelectronics.com/navone/index.php">NavOne 3000</a>) was not well received, partly because it didn&#8217;t have a touch screen. Management says they identified this shortcoming initially but that the cost of developing a touch screen through their vendor at the time was too high. Now they realize that it&#8217;s important. Makes me wonder about their product development skills, but I&#8217;m also glad to see the honesty and the learning process.</li>
<li>New GPS device (NavOne 4500, due out this quarter) will have real-time traffic info for 45 metro areas (covering 2/3 of US population). It&#8217;s apparently the only device currently on the market to have that.</li>
<li>Accounts receivables were up compared to same time last year, but are down from end of year 2004. It&#8217;s not much out of line with increase in revenue.</li>
<li>No debt</li>
<li>Book value is now over $10 per share. Even after the run up today, the market price is still below book value.</li>
<li>Cash is up. You&#8217;d think this would be a good thing, but whenever a company starts piling up cash, they start talking about &#8230; acquisitions. Management wants to take advantage of their current distribution channels with a new product. They don&#8217;t think there is much room for internal growth. Acquisitions are troublesome, because they&#8217;re difficult to do properly and because there&#8217;s so much management incentive to do them. In addition, it&#8217;s difficult for the outside investor to see how an acquisition is really doing. I&#8217;d rather see them doing a dividend or a buyback and focusing on internal growth.</li>
<li>Share count did not increase this quarter. This is so rare to see these days. Almost every company seems to be doling out options, thus diluting current shareholders out. It&#8217;s even worse to see them doing this when their market price is so low. I&#8217;m happy to see that COBR didn&#8217;t dilute (at least this quarter)</li>
<li>SG &amp; A decreased as a percent of sales. Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs should decrease next quarter and beyond. Sarbanes-Oxley is the new post-Enron/WorldCom legislation aimed at keeping companies honest. It&#8217;s apparently quite cumbersome and expensive, especially for small public companies. Thus, the rationale for the next item&#8230;</li>
<li>Management responded to an analyst who suggested the company should be taken private by saying, &#8220;We understand your rationale, but this isn&#8217;t the appropriate place to talk about it.&#8221; (paraphrased). It sounded to me like management agrees, but I&#8217;m still a newbie at these conference calls.</li>
<li>Company stated that a buyback may be a good idea, but they want an acquisition first.</li>
<li>I liked the &#8220;feel&#8221; of the management team from the conference call.</li>
</ul>


<p>I bought COBR around 7.50, so the 25% pop puts me nicely into the green. The acquisition issue is a red flag and I&#8217;ll definitely analyze that data once it&#8217;s available, but for the moment I&#8217;m holding.</p>
