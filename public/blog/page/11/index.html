  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for another post linking to <a href="http://jwatch.org">Journal Watch</a>, but they really are doing a great job of reading my mind&#8230;</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://kurup.org/blog/2006/12/24/osteoporosis-talk">talk to the residents about osteoporosis</a>, I mentioned that one of the unanswered questions is how long to treat patients with bisphosphonates. Well, a <a href="http://firstwatch.jwatch.org/cgi/content/short/2006/1227/1">randomized trial published in JAMA</a> says &#8220;5 years&#8221;. Bone density in placebo-users decreased minimally and hip fracture risk stayed the same. Vertebral fracture risk increased, but vertebral fractures are much less significant than hip fractures. I&#8217;m sure more studies will be done, but it&#8217;s reassuring to think that bisphosphonates may not be needed lifelong.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to take a <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album%5fid=80449">trip with my in-laws to India</a> last month. I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to uploading the pics, but as I look at them now, they don&#8217;t quite capture the amount of amazing stuff that we saw. I took about 400 pictures and uploaded 187 here. You&#8217;d think 400 pics would adequately capture a trip, but not for a trip to India.</p>

<p>Here are some interesting ones in case you don&#8217;t want to wade through 15 pages of pics.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read this article on <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/506299">&#8220;Health at Every Size&#8221;</a> back in July 2005, took some notes and then put it in my &#8220;To Blog About&#8221; Folder. In the &#8220;I&#8217;ll get to it &#8230; eventually&#8221; category, here are my notes from 16 months ago:</p>

<hr />

<p>Here&#8217;s a really interesting take on the problem of obesity. The movement is called &#8220;Health at every size&#8221;. Proponents argue that society and the medical establishment is too concerned with getting people to lose weight.</p>

<p>Quick Notes from the article:</p>

<ul>
<li>losing weight is a multi-billion dollar business</li>
<li>medical studies have linked obesity to multiple conditions, including HTN, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and arthritis, but these links only prove association, not necessarily causation</li>
<li>even if it could be proved that obesity causes these conditions, our current methods of treating obesity are clearly ineffective and likely are harmful to patients

<ul>
<li> 95% of patients do not lose weight</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>studies suggest that patients who are obese but that pursue healthy lifestyles are at lower risk for chronic diseases than are nonobese patients with poor lifestyle habits</li>
<li>focusing on weight as a goal causes patients to be unhappy with themselves (whether or not they meet their goals)</li>
<li>patients should be encouraged to incorporate healthy habits into their lifestyle without being concerned about their weight or appearance

<ul>
<li> focus on being functional</li>
<li> on listening to signals of hunger, appetite and satiety</li>
<li> unrestricted diet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, I do believe that obesity probably causes these chronic diseases. Studies to definitively prove causation would be difficult to conduct. In any case, it is uncontroversial that the combination of poor eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle leads to these conditions, not to mention to unhappiness.</p>

<p>So I would love to help my patients change their lifestyles. And so far, I have failed at that. Recommending diet and exercise has, as a whole, been quite ineffective.</p>

<p>I really like the approach of getting patients to be happy with themselves as people, first and foremost. I know the approach sounds hokey, but I think it&#8217;s important.</p>

<p>This approach also resonates with my own personal approach to weight. I am somewhat concerned about the actual number that shows up on the scale, but I&#8217;m much more concerned about the way I feel. I want to be able to bound up stairs and take off for long stress-releasing runs whenever I feel like it. I also want to be able to eat whatever types of food that I want, concerning myself more with eating reasonable portions based on how my body feels.</p>

<hr />

<p>It&#8217;s been more than a year since I read and wrote this. I&#8217;ve made some
small changes in the way that I counsel patients. I have tried to be
less focused on weight, and more focused on healthy lifestyles, but
it&#8217;s been difficult. I certainly don&#8217;t think my results have been that
much better. To be fair, it&#8217;s a more difficult process. It&#8217;s easy to
check a patient&#8217;s weight, give them some dietary and fitness
instructions and let them loose. It&#8217;s harder to assess, in detail,
what their habits are like and whether they are truly changing.  Of
course, there is no silver bullet to a problem like this, but I still
like the Health at Every Size motives. It&#8217;s more a &#8220;positive thinking&#8221;
approach and that fits my personality more.</p>

<p><b>HAES</b></p>
<p>
Stumbled across your blog while surfing the web.  I&#8217;ve been
incorporated HAES principles as a helath educator and in my own life
for over a year now.  It is interesting to look at the research on the
fat-health links.  When one controls for past dieting history
(yo-yoing), fitness, and nutrition, most if not all the association
between fat and poor heath disappears!  In fact, fat and healthy
people live as long as or longer than thin people.  Unfortunately,
because fat people are so encouraged to try to become thin people,
they suffer the health effects of all that dieting and forced
activity, not to mention prejudice and discrimination because people
assume fat is a result of gluttony and sloth.  We do a disservice to
both fat and thin people to assume that we can tell something about an
individual&#8217;s habits by their body size and to assume that everybody
would be within a narrow body size range if they ate right and
exercised.
</p>
<p>
A really fun book to check out on this stuff is &#8220;Big Fat Lies.&#8221;  Good
luck with your development toward HAES.  It is worth it!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Yegge wrote about the <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/ruby-tour">expressiveness of
Ruby</a> as compared to
Java. He used this simple problem as an example:</p>

<blockquote><p>How about if we write a program that will print out all the words in the dictionary starting with the letter &#8216;Q&#8217; (case-insensitive), grouped by increasing length, and sorted alphabetically within each group.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Ruby version was about 12 lines of code and Java version about
43. Of course, the point of the exercise wasn&#8217;t simply the difference
in LOCs, but in the overall simplicity of dealing with collections of
data. Still, I wanted to see how Tcl would deal with the same
problem. Here&#8217;s the simplest version I could come up with:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='tcl'>set f [open /usr/share/dict/words r]
set words [read -nonewline $f]
close $f
set qwords [lsearch -all -inline [split $words \n] {[Qq]*}]

proc compare_length {a b} {
    if { [string length $a] &lt;= [string length $b] } {
        return -1
    } else {
        return 1

<p><b>Tcl functional programming (And the example in Perl)</b></p>

<p>
I don&#8217;t do as much tcl programming as I used to, but I do do a lot of
Perl and some Ruby.
</p>

<p>
One thing I have really picked up from the Perl community is a love of
using functional programming when it makes sense (which is quite a
bit). If you want to get into functional programming in tcl there are
quite a few good resources on the tcl.tk wiki, but there&#8217;s also a
fantastic functional tcl package in openacs that every openacs
programmer should make themselves familiar with:
</p>

<p>
<a href ="http://openacs.org/api-doc/procs-file-view?version_id=358343&path=packages/acs-tcl/tcl/ad-functional-procs.tcl">[ACS Tcl 5.2.0 : ad-functional-procs.tcl</a> - full lambda functions (with no memory leaks, although a bit of memory usage)
</p>

<p>
Now, onto the fun part! I thought I&#8217;d take on the Q word example in
Perl. Here&#8217;s a reasonable way to do it in Perl:
</p>

<pre>
use strict;
open W, '/usr/share/dict/words' or die $!;
my @words = &lt;W&gt;;
chomp @words;
close W;

my $max = 0;
for my $word (sort {length $a &lt;=> length $b} sort grep { /^q/i } @words) {
    if (length $word > $max) {
        $max = length $word;
        print "Words of length $max:\n"
    }

    print "$word\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
And here&#8217;s the pathological way :)
</p>

<pre>
open W, '/usr/share/dict/words';
    
length > $max ? print 'Words of length ' . (($max = length) -1) . ":\n$_" : print

for sort {length $a &lt;=&gt; length $b} sort grep { /^q/i } &lt;W&gt;;
</pre>

<p><b>More stuff to learn</b></p>

<p>
Thanks Prem for the amusing comments about languages. I still have the
&#8220;Revenge of the Nerds&#8221; on my to-read list.
</p>

<p>
Mark, that is one scary looking snippet of Perl. :) Thanks for the
links to the functional programming procs in OpenACS. I had never seen
those. Do you know of any code that uses them?
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn some more about functional programming, but
the going has been difficult. It&#8217;s definitely a different mindset.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://kurup.org/dave/blog/2006/09/07/primary-care-medicine-perspective">Dave referenced an interesting article</a> in the NEJM titled <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/9/861">&#8220;Primary Care &#8211; Will it Survive?&#8221;</a> These two quotes summarize the problem:</p>

<blockquote><p>A 2006 report from the Center for Studying Health System Change reveals that from 1995 to 2003, inflation-adjusted income decreased by 7.1 percent for all physicians and by 10.2 percent for primary care physicians.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>It has been estimated that it would take 10.6 hours per working day to deliver all recommended care for patients with chronic conditions, plus 7.4 hours per day to provide evidence-based preventive care, to an average panel of 2500 patients (the mean U.S. panel size is 2300).</p></blockquote>

<p>Compensation is down and responsibilities are up. I&#8217;ve been especially aware of this as more than a few of my colleagues have left, without being replaced. So not only do we have more to do per patient, we have more total patients per doc. This will worsen as the population ages. These conditions are leading to a decrease in the number of students and residents who choose primary care, which of course creates a vicious cycle.</p>

<p><a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/9/861/F1"><img src="http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue9/images/large/01f1.jpeg" alt="primary care over time" /></a></p>

<p>One of the interesting solutions proposed in the article was a heavier use of web-based solutions:</p>

<blockquote><p>A more thoughtful solution to physicians&#8217; time constraints requires a combination of team care and electronic encounters. Nonphysician team members working with Web- and e-mail- based patient portals can perform routine preventive care functions and manage less complex chronic care. However, forging cohesive and efficient teams is a challenge, and few payers adequately reimburse these services.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in creating those types of solutions. The problem is that when you use these solutions and begin to speed up patient care, the temptation will be to increase the number of patients seen, rather than to spend more quality time with each patient. If you do that, you begin to break the doctor-patient relationship - a relationship that is more valuable than the purely technical aspects of care alone.</p>

<p><b>In decline, yes</b></p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not sure about dying. But conditions may have to get really bad, or more likely, a high-profile personage will have to die because of the lack of  good primary care before things change.
</p>
<p>
A recent conversation with a colleague from residency, a general
internist in private practice, revealed a high level of frustration
with policy makers who are totally disconnected from front line
realities. In large part I agree with him.
</p>
<p>
Policy makers are busy studying questions like this:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Television Watching and Other Sedentary Behaviors in Relation to Risk of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Women&#8221; (JAMA. 2003;289:1785-1791)
</p>
<p>
in order to come to conclusions like this:
</p>
<p>
Obesity is an important problem, but please, do we need a study to
prove that watching TV doesn&#8217;t help you get thinner? Next will be a
guideline that primary care docs quantify how many hours each patient
watches T.V. &#8230;..
</p>
<p>
My friend detailed regulatory changes in nursing home care that make
it harder for him to do the right thing for patients.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps another way that the internet can play a positive role in this
mess is to channel such feedback to policy makers who truly are
interested in change or to expose to the public eye frustrations
voiced by docs in private.

<i>Next will be a guideline that primary care docs quantify how many

</p>
<p>
I laughed out loud when I read this. Because it&#8217;s so true. Lately it
seems that everyone has another &#8216;pet&#8217; project that we need to
implement. HIV screening for everyone - only takes a few
minutes. Depression screening for everyone - just a few minutes. And
it&#8217;s hard to argue with it because they seem like worthwhile to do,
yet it really squeezes the time that you have with the patient.

<p><b>From a Patient&#8217;s Perspective</b></p>
<p>
As a patient with chronic depression, I find dealing with primary care
physicians to be such a frustrating and humiliating experience, I
stopped going.  Every ailment I have presented to a primary care
physician has been quickly dismissed as being &#8220;all in my head,&#8221; with
no real analysis of my symptoms.  Even potentially serious conditions,
such as 12 years of infertility or rectal bleeding, are dismissed as
being pychiatric in nature.  How a primary care physician can make a
determination that my symptoms are baseless, without doing blood work
or even a basic physical exam, is amazing to me.  That&#8217;s why I have
totally given up going to the doctor all together.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0TibQ_1zH3U">This is one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen.</a> An autistic man takes a 45 minute helicopter ride over Rome and recreates what he sees with near perfect accuracy on paper. <a href="http://xenmate.blogspot.com/2006/05/human-camera.html">More information about him</a></p>

<p>This guy&#8217;s brain is structurally the same as mine, yet its capabilities make my brain seem like it&#8217;s broken. It&#8217;s not unreasonable to think that my brain could have the same capability if it were exposed to the proper conditions. I have no idea what those conditions are, or else I&#8217;d be able to cure autism. But seeing feats like this show me that there is so much that we don&#8217;t know about our brains and their function. And that&#8217;s kinda exciting.</p>
