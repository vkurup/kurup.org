I finished it on my marathon subway rides yesterday. It&#8217;s partly a voyeuristic look into how people do or don&#8217;t survive when bad things happen. This part is pure storytelling and who doesn&#8217;t love a good story? At times, the outdoorsy jargon made it hard for me to follow what exactly was going on, but on the whole I was sucked in, turning pages to see what happened to our poor characters.</p>

<p>The other part is an analysis of why one person survives and another seemingly more equipped, more experienced person succumbs. There is, of course, no hard answer and luck is a huge component, but some common characteristics do emerge. Survivors tend to remain calm, come to terms with their likely mortality, yet continue to strive against it by adapting to their new situations as best as possible. On the other hand, &#8220;The Rambo types are the first to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Parts of Deep Survival made me wonder if I should ever go hiking in the woods ever again. His description of seemingly innocent trips gone horribly bad can scare you. But (and the author makes this clear), this is NOT the point. Life is about enjoying beauty and constantly extending your abilities. It&#8217;s just critical to understand that nature is not a supervised playground and that there are always real dangers, no matter how <em>simple</em> the excursion. Knowing that fact, being properly outfitted and prepared, and most importantly, being aware of your surroundings and instincts will decrease your risk. And with risk managed properly, the reward-to-risk ratio of immersing yourself in nature <strong>easily</strong> beats out staying secure in your daily life, which is by no means risk-free either.</p>

<p>So check out Deep Survival if you like a good story and if you want to learn a little more about what gives you the best chances of surviving a bad event.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://dailylit.com">DailyLit.com</a> is an interesting service that takes classic books and chops them up in to bite-sized pieces that you can read in just a few minutes. It then emails you one piece at a time until you finish the book. You can customize how often you get the emails.</p>

<p>I just finished &#8220;The Art of Money Getting&#8221;, by P.T. Barnum. It has a lot of practical advice, and predates (by 100 years) a lot of what you see these days in self-help books. There are a lot of gems in here, but this is one of my favorite quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Strict honesty, not only lies at the foundation of all success in life (financially), but in every other respect. Uncompromising integrity of character is invaluable. It secures to its possessor a peace and joy which cannot be attained without it&#8211;which no amount of money, or houses and lands can purchase.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to figure out what I&#8217;m reading next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s my 2006 Investment Performance update. My individual stock picks broke their 4 year winning streak versus the S&amp;P500 and overall (including my 403b), I lagged the market by a couple percentage points. That makes for a pretty lousy year overall. So, is it time to switch tactics? Give in and stick all my money in an index fund? Some would say yes (or more like &#8220;YES, you IDIOT!&#8221;). I knew when I started this approach that there would be times where I would underperform, even for long periods of time, meaning 1-2 years. But, on the whole, I would come out ahead. Small cheap companies have always outperformed over the long run. I still believe that and will continue with this approach, at least until 2009, at which point I will have a 5 year track record to analyze. In the meantime, I&#8217;m not going to cry too much about a 12.8% gain.</p>

<p>Notes: These are calculated using the XIRR function in
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>. The <a href="http://www.gummy-stuff.org/misc-stuff.htm#XIRR">XIRR
function</a> takes a
series of cash flows in or out of an account and returns the internal
rate of return for that account. It&#8217;s the best way to compare
portfolio returns when investments or withdrawals are made on an
irregular basis. The VFINX column shows how I would have done if I had
simply invested all my money into
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vfinx">VFINX</a>, a low-cost mutual fund
which tracks the S&amp;P 500. This number will not match numbers you
see posted for VFINX for a given year because it depends on the timing
of <strong>my</strong> investments. Note that I include the cost of commissions in
my performance, but not in VFINX&#8217;s.</p>

This is not an &#8220;official&#8221; thank your for tax purposes &#8211; you will
receive that via post in the next few days.  I happened upon your blog
after googling your name in an effort to reconcile an old MA address

send along an extra thanks!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for another post linking to <a href="http://jwatch.org">Journal Watch</a>, but they really are doing a great job of reading my mind&#8230;</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://kurup.org/blog/2006/12/24/osteoporosis-talk">talk to the residents about osteoporosis</a>, I mentioned that one of the unanswered questions is how long to treat patients with bisphosphonates. Well, a <a href="http://firstwatch.jwatch.org/cgi/content/short/2006/1227/1">randomized trial published in JAMA</a> says &#8220;5 years&#8221;. Bone density in placebo-users decreased minimally and hip fracture risk stayed the same. Vertebral fracture risk increased, but vertebral fractures are much less significant than hip fractures. I&#8217;m sure more studies will be done, but it&#8217;s reassuring to think that bisphosphonates may not be needed lifelong.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to take a <a href="http://kurup.org/photo/album?album%5fid=80449">trip with my in-laws to India</a> last month. I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to uploading the pics, but as I look at them now, they don&#8217;t quite capture the amount of amazing stuff that we saw. I took about 400 pictures and uploaded 187 here. You&#8217;d think 400 pics would adequately capture a trip, but not for a trip to India.</p>

<p>Here are some interesting ones in case you don&#8217;t want to wade through 15 pages of pics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read this article on <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/506299">&#8220;Health at Every Size&#8221;</a> back in July 2005, took some notes and then put it in my &#8220;To Blog About&#8221; Folder. In the &#8220;I&#8217;ll get to it &#8230; eventually&#8221; category, here are my notes from 16 months ago:</p>

<hr />

<p>Here&#8217;s a really interesting take on the problem of obesity. The movement is called &#8220;Health at every size&#8221;. Proponents argue that society and the medical establishment is too concerned with getting people to lose weight.</p>

<p>Quick Notes from the article:</p>

<ul>
<li>losing weight is a multi-billion dollar business</li>
<li>medical studies have linked obesity to multiple conditions, including HTN, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and arthritis, but these links only prove association, not necessarily causation</li>
<li>even if it could be proved that obesity causes these conditions, our current methods of treating obesity are clearly ineffective and likely are harmful to patients

<ul>
<li> 95% of patients do not lose weight</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>studies suggest that patients who are obese but that pursue healthy lifestyles are at lower risk for chronic diseases than are nonobese patients with poor lifestyle habits</li>
<li>focusing on weight as a goal causes patients to be unhappy with themselves (whether or not they meet their goals)</li>
<li>patients should be encouraged to incorporate healthy habits into their lifestyle without being concerned about their weight or appearance

<ul>
<li> focus on being functional</li>
<li> on listening to signals of hunger, appetite and satiety</li>
<li> unrestricted diet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, I do believe that obesity probably causes these chronic diseases. Studies to definitively prove causation would be difficult to conduct. In any case, it is uncontroversial that the combination of poor eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle leads to these conditions, not to mention to unhappiness.</p>

<p>So I would love to help my patients change their lifestyles. And so far, I have failed at that. Recommending diet and exercise has, as a whole, been quite ineffective.</p>

<p>I really like the approach of getting patients to be happy with themselves as people, first and foremost. I know the approach sounds hokey, but I think it&#8217;s important.</p>

<p>This approach also resonates with my own personal approach to weight. I am somewhat concerned about the actual number that shows up on the scale, but I&#8217;m much more concerned about the way I feel. I want to be able to bound up stairs and take off for long stress-releasing runs whenever I feel like it. I also want to be able to eat whatever types of food that I want, concerning myself more with eating reasonable portions based on how my body feels.</p>

<hr />

<p>It&#8217;s been more than a year since I read and wrote this. I&#8217;ve made some
small changes in the way that I counsel patients. I have tried to be
less focused on weight, and more focused on healthy lifestyles, but
it&#8217;s been difficult. I certainly don&#8217;t think my results have been that
much better. To be fair, it&#8217;s a more difficult process. It&#8217;s easy to
check a patient&#8217;s weight, give them some dietary and fitness
instructions and let them loose. It&#8217;s harder to assess, in detail,
what their habits are like and whether they are truly changing.  Of
course, there is no silver bullet to a problem like this, but I still
like the Health at Every Size motives. It&#8217;s more a &#8220;positive thinking&#8221;
approach and that fits my personality more.</p>

<p><b>HAES</b></p>
<p>
Stumbled across your blog while surfing the web.  I&#8217;ve been
incorporated HAES principles as a helath educator and in my own life
for over a year now.  It is interesting to look at the research on the
fat-health links.  When one controls for past dieting history
(yo-yoing), fitness, and nutrition, most if not all the association
between fat and poor heath disappears!  In fact, fat and healthy
people live as long as or longer than thin people.  Unfortunately,
because fat people are so encouraged to try to become thin people,
they suffer the health effects of all that dieting and forced
activity, not to mention prejudice and discrimination because people
assume fat is a result of gluttony and sloth.  We do a disservice to
both fat and thin people to assume that we can tell something about an
individual&#8217;s habits by their body size and to assume that everybody
would be within a narrow body size range if they ate right and
exercised.
</p>
<p>
A really fun book to check out on this stuff is &#8220;Big Fat Lies.&#8221;  Good
luck with your development toward HAES.  It is worth it!
