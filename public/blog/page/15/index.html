  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that credit card companies are charging extra fees for foreign
transactions, you need to know where online companies are physically
located. For example, did you know that
<a href="http://abebooks.com">Abebooks</a>, an online aggregator of bookstores,
is based in Canada? We found out when we bought books from them and
found our credit card statement littered with foreign transaction
fees. The ironic thing is that the book actually shipped from the
U.S. (from Amazon.com, in fact). Of course, there&#8217;s not much Abebooks
can do about this, but you need to calculate the extra costs into the
transaction to see whether you&#8217;re still getting a good deal.</p>

<p><b>Amazon.com charges credit cards directly</b></p>
<p>
Hi Vinod. I work in the online book industry. If you bought the book
from the Amazon.com website, they  charge credit cards directly,
rather than passing it along to Marketplace/zShops booksellers. The
charges couldn&#8217;t have been generated by Abebooks, because they never
got your credit card information.
</p>

<p>
Is it possible that (1) you bought the book directly from Abebooks,
rather than Amazon.com, (2) you bought the book from a non-US
Amazon.com site (e.g. Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk), or (3) that the
foreign transaction fees are for something altogether different?

<p><b>Yes, I bought directly from Abebooks</b></p>
<p>
Sorry if I wasn&#8217;t clear about that. I didn&#8217;t buy from Amazon.com. As I
said in the post, I bought online on the Abebooks.com website. The
book just happened to come &#8220;packaged&#8221; in an Amazon cardboard box.

<p><b>Abe CC</b></p>
<p>
This will be more and more of an issue as Abebooks moves to process
the credit card transactions for all of their booksellers.
</p>
<p>
You can be an American buyer purchasing from an American seller and
still pay the 2-3% surcharge solely because ABE is in Canada.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s time for my quarterly investment update. Every 3 months, I look at my portfolio and sell stocks that I don&#8217;t like and then buy ones that I do. This quarter, I&#8217;m doing <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>

<p>This is one of the hardest things for me to do. I like to trade. Sell a stock here, buy a new one here. It&#8217;s exciting. Especially when you sell a stock that&#8217;s been down for a while because then you no longer have to look at that red smirch on your portfolio every day. But while activity is a good thing in almost every other aspect of life, it can hurt you in investing. The undisputable fact is that the more you trade, the more you&#8217;ll lose on commissions and spreads. What&#8217;s more disputable, but true in my mind is that investing overactivity makes me do dumb things.</p>

<p>A couple of the stocks that I had sold over the past year have made strong runs since I sold them. AMN has gained 47% and DUCK has gained 20%. I probably shouldn&#8217;t have sold either of them, if I had followed my strict evaluation process. But I <strong>wanted</strong> to sell them. Each company had its problems, so I found good reasons to sell and justifed them to myself. The problem was that I didn&#8217;t follow the sell criteria that I had set up before I bought the stocks. I made up new ones just so I could sell the stock. If I had stuck with my initial criteria, I&#8217;d still be holding on to those two and enjoying my gains.</p>

<p>I guess my lesson is that you should decide under what conditions you would sell any stock <strong>before you buy it</strong>. Until those conditions appear, hold tight. This is especially true for small undervalued stocks because it can take a long time for the market to come around and properly value them. James Cloonan, over at <a href="http://aaii.com/">The American Association of Individual Investors</a> runs a <a href="http://aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/">Shadow Stock Portfolio</a> on which my portfolio is loosely based. He recommends giving small-cap value stocks at least 2 years to be recognized by the market.</p>

<p>Patience, young grasshopper!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="/blog/2005/02/04/investment-performance-1996-2004">promised last
year</a>, here&#8217;s my
2005 Investment Performance update. My 403b account (VFINX, VWNDX,
VEXPX and VTRIX) was up 6.7% and my individual stock investments were
up 22.0% as compared to the stock market (VFINX) being up 4.7%. That
makes 4 years in a row that my overall investments have beat the index
and 2 years in a row that my stock picks have. It&#8217;s that second
comparison that is most important to me - my individual stock picks
versus the index. I have little control over our 403b accounts, being
limited only to mutual funds, so I have much less confidence that I&#8217;ll
be able to consistently outperform there.</p>

<p>Notes: These are calculated using the XIRR function in
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>. The <a href="http://www.gummy-stuff.org/misc-stuff.htm#XIRR">XIRR
function</a> takes a
series of cash flows in or out of an account and returns the internal
rate of return for that account. It&#8217;s the best way to compare
portfolio returns when investments or withdrawals are made on an
irregular basis. The VFINX column shows how I would have done if I had
simply invested all my money into
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vfinx">VFINX</a>, a low-cost mutual fund
which tracks the S&amp;P 500. This number will not match numbers you
see posted for VFINX for a given year because it depends on the timing
of <strong>my</strong> investments. Note that I include the cost of commissions in
my performance, but not in VFINX&#8217;s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh, in my last post, I forgot to mention one other cause we supported - <a href="http://nybg.org">The New York Botanical Gardens</a>. I don&#8217;t really think of it as charity, since we definitely get our money&#8217;s worth of enjoyment out of the park. In addition, the gardens gave their members a gift this year - the Phillips Senseo Coffee Maker. This is one of those Pod coffee makers. You stick in a coffee-pod and the machine shoots boiling water through the pod and into your coffee mug. It makes 1 cup at a time, but it takes only 30 seconds, so making coffee for a group is just a matter of lining up a bunch of cups and changing the pod each time. Cleanup is easy and the coffee is suprisingly good.</p>

<p>But, the pods are a little expensive - it comes to about 30-40 cents per cup. And, while the coffee is good, I sure miss my <a href="http://www.themudtruck.com/">MUD</a>. Well, good news. <a href="http://www.ineedcoffee.com/04/coffeepods/">You can make your own coffee pods!</a>. Once I find the right tools (vitamin jars?), I&#8217;m going to try this, despite this ominous warning:</p>

<blockquote><p>Be careful not to use too big of filter or to make sloppy folds. If you plug up your machine the pressure build up will either <strong>spray hot water all over the place</strong> or will engage the safety locks which prevent the lid from being re-opened.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eff.org/about/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> - The internet is the most innovative force in our lives and the EFF working to preserve freedom on the net.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/">WNYC</a> - To support my NPR Podcast habit. I wanted to give directly to <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> since I only listen to podcasts and not to the local radio station, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out a way to donate to NPR on their website.</li>
<li>Epilepsy Foundation of South Central Wisconsin, American Cancer Society - donations for friends who were raising money.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d like to become a better writer. In order to become a better writer, you simply have to write more. Funny how most things are like that. Still, sometimes you want a little more structure. MIT has a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/writing/Resources/Writers/process.html">nice guide to writing</a> that is both simple and useful. Start out by making your document <strong>writer-centric</strong>. Just get the words down on paper. Satisfy only yourself. Then, revise your writing to make it <strong>reader-centric</strong>. Add evidence, details, and explanations that your audience would need. I think this is a useful distinction because I often get bogged down thinking about what others might think when I should just be writing.</p>
