<p>Today, I listened to
<a href="http://nsbrief.com/62-mark-aufflick">Mark Aufflick&#8217;s interview</a> where
he talks eloquently about starting your own business. I love the
perspective he had on his first business and how shutting it down gave
him the necessary (though painful) experience to make his current
business work. He also talked about the importance of computing
history especially given the availability of interesting subjects. He
ended with great advice on the importance of professionalism.
Paraphrased: &#8220;Make sure your team is the most professional side of any
relationship.&#8221;</p>

<p>I know <a href="http://borkware.com">Mark</a> and
<a href="http://mark.aufflick.com/">Mark</a> from the
<a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a> glory days and it&#8217;s great to hear how
well they&#8217;re doing. Computing history was a prominent part of both
talks. I think this is important. Old ideas are always new again. Some
of the ideas that these pioneers had were only limited by the
horsepower we had to work with at the time. Now thanks to Moore&#8217;s law,
those limitations are gone, so we should re-investigate those ideas.
Or maybe we&#8217;re all just getting old and like to talk about the
good-old-days. :-) It&#8217;s nice to see that they both mentioned the
OpenACS period of their programming lives as important. It certainly
was for me. It was also great to hear Mark Aufflick&#8217;s voice for the
first time, even though I feel like he&#8217;s been a friend for many years.</p>

<time datetime="2012-10-24T16:45:49-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 24<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Note: See the bottom of this post for updates)</p>

<p>I was honored to to give my
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/vkurup/emacs-for-python-programming">&#8220;Emacs for Python Programming&#8221;</a>
talk at the inaugural <a href="http://pycarolinas.org">PyCarolinas</a>
conference. The conference was a huge success in every way, thanks to
the efforts of <a href="http://www.ironfroggy.com/">Calvin Spealman</a>, et. al.
I promised that I would post my Emacs setup, so here it is.</p>

<h2>Step 0: Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This may work with other setups, but here&#8217;s what I tested:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Emacs version 24</li>
<li>python 2.7 or 3.3</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/">virtualenv</a></li>
<li><a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/">virtualenvwrapper</a></li>
<li>git</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step 1: Clear out any previous customization</h2>

<p>As evidenced by the numerous blog posts documenting how to set this
up, it&#8217;s not straightforward. I recommend starting from scratch to
make sure everything is set up properly. Once you have it working,
then you can customize it. Make sure to start these commands in your
home directory.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir old-emacs
</span><span class='line'>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span>mv .emacs .emacs.d old-emacs/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 2: Set up initial Emacs configuration</h2>

<p>Create an empty <code>.emacs.d</code> directory and a subdirectory named with your
username. My username is <code>vinod</code>, so we&#8217;ll create a directory
structure called <code>.emacs.d/vinod/</code>. The emacs-starter-kit tells emacs
to automatically load any elisp files from that special directory, so
you&#8217;ll always have a place to drop custom elisp files.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/<span class="nv">$USER</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create a file named <code>.emacs.d/init.el</code> with the following contents:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>my-init.el</span><a href='https://gist.github.com/3948955'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>Step 3: Create a python virtualenv</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ll keep all the python-side customization in a virtualenv named
<code>default</code>. It&#8217;s important that the name you choose is the same as the
name in the <code>(virtualenv-workon)</code> command in line 45 of Step 2.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span>mkvirtualenv -p python2 default
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After it does its thing, your shell prompt should change, indicating
that your new virtualenv is activated</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>default<span class="o">)</span>vinod:~<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 4: Install Pymacs</h2>

<p><a href="http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/index.html">Pymacs</a> is a really cool
piece of software that sets up a 2 way communication between Emacs and
Python, allowing you to control Emacs with python commands rather than
elisp commands. It requires a python piece (<code>Pymacs.py</code>) and an Emacs
piece (<code>pymacs.el</code>). Unfortunately, they&#8217;re not installable via <code>pip</code>
or <code>package.el</code>, but installation is easy enough.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 5: Install other python packages</h2>

<p>These helper packages are easier to install:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>default<span class="o">)</span>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span>pip install pyflakes pep8
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The pyflakes and pep8 packages check your code as you type using
Emacs&#8217; flymake mode. Now, deactivate your virtualenv.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>default<span class="o">)</span>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span>deactivate
</span><span class='line'>vinod:~<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 6: Install pycheckers</h2>

<p>Flymake is the part of Emacs that checks your code for errors on the
fly. It calls a shell script called <code>pycheckers</code>, so you need to have
a script by that name in your shell&#8217;s <code>PATH</code>. Here&#8217;s mine
(<code>~/bin/pycheckers</code>):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>pycheckers.sh</span><a href='https://gist.github.com/3948973'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>pyflakes <span class="s2">&quot;$1&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>pep8 --repeat <span class="s2">&quot;$1&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 7: Install python-mode.el</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in my talk, there are multiple Python modes available,
but I recommend using the one named python-mode.el, which is developed
at
<a href="http://launchpad.net/python-mode">http://launchpad.net/python-mode</a>.
It does periodically get uploaded to
<a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/python-mode">Marmalade</a>, but the
auto-completion using pycomplete doesn&#8217;t work well on the version that
is there now (6.0.10), so I recommend that you manually download and
install the latest stable version (6.0.12). I&#8217;ll update this post once
a stable working version gets uploaded to
<a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade</a> or
<a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/">Melpa</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.emacs.d/<span class="nv">$USER</span>
</span><span class='line'>vinod:~/.emacs.d/vinod<span class="nv">$ </span>curl -L https://launchpad.net/python-mode/trunk/6.0.12/+download/python-mode.el-6.0.12.tar.gz | tar xz
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 8: Test it all out</h2>

<p>Launch emacs and open a python file named <code>test.py</code>. Type the following:</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.path.jo
</code></pre>

<p>Wait at this point. You should see auto-completion of <code>os.path.join</code>
followed shortly by a yellow popup showing documentation of that method.
Hitting return should accept the completion. Then type <code>(</code> and you
should see the method signature in the minibuffer.</p>

<p>Move the cursor over any letter in <code>join</code>. Hit &#8216;F1&#8217;. A window should
popup with the docstring for <code>os.path.join</code>. Hit &#8216;F2&#8217;. A new window
should be opened with the code for <code>os.path.join</code>. Hit &#8216;F3&#8217;. You&#8217;ll be
prompted to enter the name of any python command, and Emacs will show
you the docstring.</p>

<p>Type the string &#8216;blah&#8217; and hit return. The string should be
highlighted in pink and if you mouseover it, the minibuffer will say
<code>undefined name 'blah'</code>. That&#8217;s flymake working for you.</p>

<p>Hit <code>C-c C-c</code> and the buffer should be sent to a Python interpreter and
you&#8217;ll be dropped in the REPL after the code has been loaded. Any
errors in the code will be reported.</p>

<p>If all of this works, then CONGRATULATIONS!!! If not, let me know and
I&#8217;ll see if I can help debug.</p>

<h2>Step 9: Customize</h2>

<p>All of this is customizable in hundreds of ways. Try <code>M-x
customize-group RET python-mode RET</code> to see how.</p>

<h2>Step 10: How to create a new python project</h2>

<p>Whenever you want to create a new Python project, you have do the
following:</p>

<h3>Create a new virtualenv</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span>mkvirtualenv newproject
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Install pymacs into that virtualenv</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>newproject<span class="o">)</span>vinod:~<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/src/Pymacs
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>newproject<span class="o">)</span>vinod:~/src/Pymacs<span class="nv">$ </span>make install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Install the other pip modules</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>newproject<span class="o">)</span>vinod:~/src/Pymacs<span class="nv">$ </span>pip install pyflakes pep8
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Switch to that virtualenv in emacs</h3>

<pre><code>M-x virtualenv-workon RET newproject/ RET
</code></pre>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<h3>Changing virtualenvs doesn&#8217;t restart Pymacs</h3>

<p>For the most part, this won&#8217;t affect much, but if you move from a
Python2 project to a Python3 project, you may have problems. The
workaround is to call <code>M-x pymacs-terminate-services</code>, then <code>M-x
virtualenv-workon</code> to change your virtualenv, and then finally
<code>M-x load-pycomplete</code> to restart pymacs and pycomplete.</p>

<h3>Latest stable version of python-mode.el isn&#8217;t on Melpa</h3>

<p>I&#8217;d much prefer to just load python-mode using the built-in Emacs
package manager.</p>

<h3>Pymacs installation is harder than it needs to be</h3>

<p>I wish Pymacs could be installed by a 2 step process</p>

<ol>
<li>pip install Pymacs</li>
<li>M-x package-install RET pymacs RET</li>
</ol>


<h3>Which pycheckers to use?</h3>

<p>My script uses pep8 and pyflakes. There are a lot of other options out
there and I do not know which is best. See
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1428872/pylint-pychecker-or-pyflakes">this post</a>
for more details.</p>

<h3>Not using ropemacs any more</h3>

<p>In my talk, I used ropemacs. In this setup, I have decided against it.
I was mostly using it for code-completion and documentation lookup,
but I like pycomplete.el better for those purposes. It&#8217;s included in
python-mode and it shows method signatures as you type. Ropemacs does
have other features such as project management (easily jumping to
files in the same project), and refactoring (changing variable names
throughout project). I haven&#8217;t used those, so I decided not to install
ropemacs.</p>

<h3>Project management not included</h3>

<p>I haven&#8217;t yet decided which package to use for this. I&#8217;ll probably try
projectile, but there are many other options, some lightweight
(ropemacs, eproject, pony-mode) and some heavyweight (ecb, CEDET).</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<h4>2012-10-27</h4>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/danpoirier">@danpoirier</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.com/gregnewman">@gregnewman</a> for testing. I initially
recommended using the master branch of python-mode.el, but now I
recommend using the latest stable release (as of now) which is version
6.0.12 to avoid problems loading Pymacs. There&#8217;s a bug on 6.0.12 with
<code>virtualenv-workon</code> that requires you to put a trailing slash after
the name of your virtualenv, so I&#8217;ve updated the <code>init.el</code> file above
to account for those changes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/">Autocomplete Mode</a> is an
Emacs mode that tries to guess what word you&#8217;re typing and provide
auto-completion. Recently, it started failing in simple scenarios.</p>

<p>It can use various &#8216;sources&#8217; to try to figure out what you&#8217;re about to
type. The simplest source is <code>ac-source-dictionary</code> which is a simple
list of words. If you start typing any of those words, it will try to
autocomplete them for you. Normally, you&#8217;d put those words in a file,
with each word on a separate line, but for testing purposes, you can
also add them manually using an elisp function. Here&#8217;s the test that
failed for me:</p>

<pre><code>(add-to-list 'ac-user-dictionary "foobar@example.com")
</code></pre>

<p>That adds the email address to the dictionary. Then, typing &#8216;foo&#8217; in
any buffer, should offer to autocomplete the entire email address.
Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t working.</p>

<p>To debug, I typed &#8216;foo&#8217; and then did <code>M-x auto-complete</code>, which forces
auto-complete to look for a completion. This resulted in an error in
the Minibuffer:</p>

<pre><code>ac-yasnippet-candidates: Symbol's function definition is void: yas/current-snippet-table
</code></pre>

<p>This led me to check which &#8216;sources&#8217; autocomplete was trying to use:
<code>C-h v ac-sources</code></p>

<pre><code>(ac-source-features ac-source-functions ac-source-yasnippet
 ac-source-variables ac-source-symbols ac-source-abbrev
 ac-source-dictionary ac-source-words-in-same-mode-buffers)
</code></pre>

<p>So, autocomplete is looking through each one of those sources, trying
to find possible words I might be typing. The third one is called
<code>ac-source-yasnippet</code>, which seems to be where my error is coming
from.</p>

<p>So, I looked into the yasnippet source code and found that, indeed,
there was no function named <code>yas/current-snippet-table</code>. That function
has been renamed to <code>yas--get-snippets-table</code> in version 0.8.0, but
autocomplete is still relying on the old function name. (RANT: Don&#8217;t
rename functions that others might be using without providing some
kind of alias, at least temporarily) I looked at the code for
<a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete">autosnippet on github</a>
and noted that the latest version has been fixed to use the new code,
but it hasn&#8217;t yet been released on MELPA. Until it is, the quick
solution is to remove <code>ac-source-yasnippet</code> from <code>ac-sources</code>.</p>

<pre><code>(delq 'ac-source-yasnippet ac-sources)
</code></pre>

<p>Then typing &#8216;foo&#8217; autocompletes to &#8216;foobar@example.com&#8217;.</p>

<p>It seems that autocomplete should be more forgiving of errors in any
specific &#8216;source&#8217;, passing it up to use other sources. Alternatively,
it should fail loudly when there&#8217;s an error, so that I can know to fix
or remove the offending &#8216;source&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was a huge Apple fan growing up and IBM was Apple&#8217;s enemy. Buying an
IBM computer would have been unthinkable.</p>

<p>Well, the unthinkable has happened. Of course IBM doesn&#8217;t make laptops
anymore, but their computers live on under the Lenovo name. I am the
proud owner of a new <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t420s">Lenovo Thinkpad
T420S</a>. I
love this computer. It&#8217;s an ugly black boxy thing, but it&#8217;s light (4
lbs), quiet and speedy. And the keyboard is just pure awesome. That&#8217;s
the main reason that I bought the T420S as opposed to the current T430
line. The new line has the chicklet keyboard that is being used on all
laptops these days. The T420 is the last one with the old-fashioned
clicky keyboard, which I love.</p>

<p>I also feel very lucky to get the deal that I got. I bought it from
<a href="http://outlet.lenovo.com">Lenovo&#8217;s Outlet store</a>, which had about
thirty T420s&#8217;s in stock when I was shopping. This one was about half
the price of the others, by my estimation. It&#8217;s so underpriced that
I&#8217;m wondering if I&#8217;m missing an obvious flaw, but I don&#8217;t see it.
(Please let me know if you do!)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a comparison between the specs of my computer compared to one
that was available at the Outlet store on October 4th, 2012:</p>

<p>The RAM is better on the other model, but Windows 7 Professional is an
upgrade on my model. I don&#8217;t really understand why mine was so cheap,
but I&#8217;m pretty happy about it!</p>

<p>I added another 4G of RAM, moved Windows to a VirtualBox image and
installed Arch Linux with Xmonad. It takes about 10 seconds to get
from the BIOS screen to a working computer. I&#8217;ll post some info on my
setup in a future post.</p>

<time datetime="2012-08-21T12:01:25-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 21<span>st</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Time for some pop philosophy. I&#8217;ve never thought too deeply about the
concept of free will. Of course we have free will! I chose to live my
life a certain way. I could choose to live a different way. It is my
free will to choose how I live. I&#8217;ve never thought about it more
deeply than that.</p>

<p>I recently read Walter Isaacson&#8217;s biography of Einstein and I was
forced to think more deeply about free will. The biography is
excellent. It gives more depth to Einstein, who, despite his flaws, is
still a heroic figure. One day, I&#8217;ll do a proper review, but the piece
that struck me the hardest was Einstein&#8217;s views on free will. He
didn&#8217;t believe that free will existed, and not only that, he didn&#8217;t
even to seem to think that this was a controversial position. It
appears that Isaacson didn&#8217;t either, because he didn&#8217;t spend much time
on that part of Einstein&#8217;s character. But, it seemed so strange to me,
since I assumed that we all have free will.</p>

<p>So, I read Sam Harris&#8217;s e-book
<a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Free Will</a>, in which he concisely
explains why free will is a myth. Take any conscious decision that you
might make. Let&#8217;s say you choose at this moment to go eat a pizza. Do
you have the free will to make that choice? Well, you certainly can go
eat pizza, but the question is if you had the free will to do it. What
were the steps that led to making that choice. Somewhere in your
brain, a certain set of neurons fired to trigger the idea in your mind
to have a pizza. How did those neurons fire? Either there was a
conscious decision to have that thought, or it was an unconscious
decision that you didn&#8217;t control. And if it was a conscious decision,
then you can take that back a step further and ask how that decision
occurred. Eventually, you will have to start at some unconscious (or
subconscious) event which triggered the series of events which
eventually led to your decision to have a pizza. No matter how far
back you can track the conscious trail that led to a pizza forming in
your mind, eventually you are left with an unconscious starting point.
Certainly all of these thoughts are heavily influenced by your life
experiences. If you&#8217;ve never seen or heard of a pizza, there&#8217;s a zero
percent chance that you&#8217;ll think of a eating a pizza. But all of those
life experiences are themselves the result of conscious and
unconscious decisions, all of which we ultimately have no specific
control over.</p>

<p>Every thought you have is the only thought you could have at that
moment. It is the result of all of the life experiences and thoughts
that you have had up to that moment. If you consciously try to
&#8220;create&#8221; an original thought, just to prove that you have free will,
well&#8230; you can&#8217;t. Because that decision itself originated from
somewhere in your subconscious, and is therefore something that you
don&#8217;t have conscious control over.</p>

<p>In addition to this theoretical rationalization against the concept of
free will, Harris describes multiple studies from neuroscience
which show that neurons fire in our subconscious well before we
develop the urge to act. Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/3/623.short">The famous Libet Experiment from 1983</a></li>
<li><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05994.x/full#ss4">Decoding and predicting
intentions</a>.
Skip to the the short section titled &#8216;Implications for the free-will debate?&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627310010822">Internally Generated Preactivation of Single Neurons in Human
Medial Frontal Cortex Predicts
Volition</a>.
The neuroscience in this article is pretty deep. I only watched the
video abstract.</li>
</ul>


<p>Bottom line: I&#8217;m convinced that I don&#8217;t have the free will that I
thought I did. The question is how this should affect my life. It
could be depressing. If every thought of mine originates in a way that
I don&#8217;t control, then am I just being steered through life? It makes
my accomplishments in life seem less &#8220;worthy&#8221;. On the other hand, it
can be quite freeing. My path through life is determined. Perhaps I
shouldn&#8217;t be worrying so much about every decision, because I know
that they&#8217;re not really &#8220;my&#8221; decisions to make. It can also give you
more empathy for others, knowing that they also have no will do
anything but what they are doing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still a confusing topic, because I &#8220;feel&#8221; like I have options in
life and I &#8220;feel&#8221; like taking different options will change my life.
That part is true. The part that isn&#8217;t true is that I have any control
over the range of available options, nor over the specific option that
I choose. Even Harris seems to be a little conflicted here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Losing a belief in free will has not made me fatalisticâ€”in fact, it has increased my feelings of freedom. My hopes, fears, and neuroses seem less personal and indelible. There is no telling how much I might change in the future. Just as one wouldnâ€™t draw a lasting conclusion about oneself on the basis of a brief experience of indigestion, one neednâ€™t do so on the basis of how one has thought or behaved for vast stretches of time in the past. A creative change of inputs to the systemâ€”learning new skills, forming new relationships, adopting new habits of attentionâ€”may radically transform oneâ€™s life.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question is how do you accomplish a &#8216;creative change of inputs&#8217;,
if you don&#8217;t have the will to do so? I guess the idea is that while I
don&#8217;t have any control over the thoughts that arise in my brain, I do
have perceived control over my decisions. With whatever power my
conscious brain has, I can choose things that will improve my life,
with the hope that exposure to new experiences will &#8216;change the
inputs&#8217; to my subconscious brain. Ugh, just thinking about how this
all works makes my brain hurt. I guess this is why I never studied
philosophy before. :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Free Will</a> is short and cheap and
I highly recommend it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up, got ready and went downstairs. I am not a morning person. I
try to do as little thinking as possible, because thinking eventually
leads to the rational conclusion that I should just go back to bed. I
get to the coffee machine, grab my plastic mug and start pouring.
Suddenly, I&#8217;m woken from my daze. I hear little footsteps pounding
across the hallway above me. I look towards the bottom of the stairs
and see a little figure race around the corner with a determined,
slightly fearful look in her face. She&#8217;s afraid that she&#8217;s too late
and that I&#8217;ve already left for work. She spies me and I must be
smiling because her face melts into the biggest, happiest smile and
her pace quickens. We run to meet each other in a big hug. &#8220;Daddy, can
I watch the milk go in your coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moments like that are so joyous, and I have underestimated how much
they mean to me. I want to capture them and never let them go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like the rest of the geek world, we&#8217;ve been excited by Curiosity&#8217;s
successful trip to Mars. Here&#8217;s a cool video which combines an
animation of Curiosity&#8217;s landing mixed with the real reactions of the
astronauts that got it there. (Found on <a href="http://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/28851131280">thekidshouldseethis.com</a>)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been disappointed that real space travel is unlikely to become a
reality during my life. I honestly thought it would when I was a kid.
But watching Curiosity gives me hope that we will be able to continue
exploring our universe. This trip to Mars was much more of an
achievement than the last one. Here&#8217;s an animation of the last trip
(2003 Mars Exploration). Note that the final landing was achieved by
an air bag dropped roughly from high up in the air. Not much precision
required there.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/curiosity-size.jpg" width="300" height="200" title="Curiosity is huge (NASA)" ></p>

<p>The Curiosity rover is too large for the airbag approach (See image at
right comparing it to previous rovers), so an alternate system was
devised using a sky crane which gently lowered the rover onto the
Martian surface. Dropping an airbag seems much easier than gently
landing a rover without damage. The real advance in our lifetime is
that our machines are getting more intelligent. And the exciting thing
is that I can actually participate in that type of exploration. I
think I just convinced myself to <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373/CourseRev/apr2012">learn how to program a robotic
car!</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to start blogging more. I know I&#8217;ve said that before, so
take it for what it&#8217;s worth. I think there is value in blogging. I&#8217;ve
been thinking about my life a lot lately, trying to find what makes me
tick. One of those things that gets me excited is programming. I
started thinking about that and remembered this meme that had passed
around the blog world a few years back. It was a list of questions
related to how you got started programming. I remember it especially
because I remember reading MarkD&#8217;s version and thinking how similar it
was to my own beginnings. Then, because I love going off on tangents,
I googled for &#8216;How I got started in programming&#8217; to read other
responses. Many of the posts I found were on abandoned blogs. And now,
for the &#8216;causal relationship not supported by data&#8217; statement. This is
because of Facebook and Twitter. OK, maybe it&#8217;s just the natural decay
of blogs. But I am concerned about the fact that most people write in
forums that are controlled by other people rather in their own forum.
That was one of the cool promises of the web. A little place of your
own that you controlled. Facebook and Twitter and Google+ are all cool
services, but the more time I spend on them, the less time I spend
here. I&#8217;m sure other people have written about this with more
eloquence than I could, but the bottom line is that I want to keep
writing. I want to learn more about myself, I want to teach others
what little I know, and I want to learn from others. I&#8217;ve been
journalling a lot lately and that has been useful, but the act of
hitting &#8216;publish&#8217; will make my writing better. That&#8217;s what this blog
is for and I&#8217;m going to start using it again.</p>

<p>Maybe one of these days, I&#8217;ll even put up my own answers to &#8216;How I Got
Started in Programming&#8217;, but in the meantime, go read
<a href="http://borkwarellc.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/how-i-got-started-in-programming/">MarkD&#8217;s</a></p>
