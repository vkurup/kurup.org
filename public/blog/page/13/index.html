  <div class="entry-content"><p>The duration of treatment for a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is problematic. Most patients who have one will never have another one, yet those who do have a 5% risk of death due to their recurrent DVT. We need a simple test which separates one group from the other.</p>

<p>This weeks JAMA (no link as issue is not online yet) reports on an article claiming that thrombin generation may be that test. Thrombin is one of the key factors in coagulation and the theory is that patients who generate excess amounts of thrombin are predisposed to developing blood clots. This cohort study showed that patients with peak thrombin generation below 400 nM had a 60% lower risk of developing a recurrent DVT over the course of about 5 years of follow up.</p>

<p>The limiting feature of this study is that they excluded patients with Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency and SLE. They also excluded patients with cancer, recent pregnancy, recent trauma, or recent surgery.</p>

<p>That means that before we use this test, we need to make sure that we&#8217;ve excluded all of the above diagnoses first. That doesn&#8217;t make it such a useful screening test. It would be useful to know is whether patients with Protein C deficiency (as an example) with low thrombin-generation values are at high risk for recurrent DVT. That is, does thrombin-generation trump Protein C deficiency, or vice versa.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;d like to have is a test that told me either 1) The patient is low risk or 2) The patient needs further testing. Then, I could do a simple test in all patients with DVT and only send the complicated hypercoagulable workup in patients who had a positive screening test. It seems like thrombin-generation may eventually be that test.</p>

<p>Also in this issue of the journal is a nice quote from Thoreau:</p>

<blockquote><p>Write while the heat is in you &#8230; The writer who postpones the recording of his thoughts uses an iron which has cooled to burn a hole with. He cannot inflame the minds of his audience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Good advice, which I need to take more often.</p>

That quote always gets credited to Thoreau instead of me. I believe I
told you two weeks ago to &#8220;blog more&#8221; which is a less flowery approach
to Thoreau&#8217;s basic sentiment. He&#8217;s such a snooze anyway - has anybody
really ever read all of Walden? ;)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blair Corp, a company in my portfolio, announced second quarter earnings today. They were disappointing, but not as disappointing as reported by <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com">bizjournals</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bizj/060724/1320068.html">&#8220;Blair Corp. swings to loss&#8221;</a> is the title of the article. While dramatic, it&#8217;s completely wrong.</p>

<blockquote><p>Blair Corp., a catalog clothing retailer and direct marketer, reported a loss in the second quarter as sales fell nearly 5 percent.</p></blockquote>

<p>False. They reported a profit of $233,000 in the second quarter.</p>

<blockquote><p>Blair said its second-quarter results were negatively impacted by the sale of its credit portfolio and last August&#8217;s stock buyback of 4.4 million shares.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not true. The buyback doesn&#8217;t affect the operating results. If anything, they made the reported results look <strong>better</strong> than they really are. The stock buyback reduced the amount of outstanding shares by about one-half, so the reported earnings-per-share (EPS) results are about twice what they would have been without the buyback.</p>

<p>None of this is to deny the fact that Blair&#8217;s results were terrible and that the stock price has been even worse. I&#8217;m a little appeased by the fact that web sales increased by about 18% versus last quarter. Perhaps a few smart minds will start pursing the web angle as the wave of the future!</p>

<time datetime="2006-05-16T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 16<span>th</span>, 2006</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Automated testing is a good thing. For my running log application, I have a proc that creates a new log for a user, called rl::runner::new. If you happen to call it for a user who already has a log, it returns the already created log. When I created the proc way back when, I also created an automated test to make sure that creation worked and that redundant calls returned the orignal log.</p>

<p>Over time, I added some code to make sure that users are given proper permissions on their log. Anytime you make a change, you should run your tests, but of course, I didn&#8217;t :-) Well, today I did and my test now failed.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant (edited) code:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='tcl'>set runner_id [db_nextval acs_object_id_seq] 
set ret_val [db_exec_plsql new_runner {}]
permission::grant -party_id $user_id -object_id $runner_id -privilege admin
permission::grant -party_id $user_id -object_id $runner_id -privilege write</code></pre>
</div>


<p>The error was happening in <code>permission::grant</code>. It was complaining that <code>$runner_id</code> wasn&#8217;t a valid acs_object. What&#8217;s going on? It looks like it should work. The problem is that I should be granting the permission on <code>ret_val</code>, not on <code>runner_id</code>. (Probably a bad choice of variable names). The first time a log is created, <code>db_exec_plsql</code> returns a value which happens to be the same as <code>runner_id</code>. The second time it&#8217;s called, it returns a value which is <strong>different</strong> and <code>permission::grant</code> fails.</p>

<p>I would never have caught this error until I tried to call <code>rl::runner::new</code> the second time on the same user. Which would make it one of those very difficult to track bugs. Automated testing saved me a lot of annoying debugging.</p>

<p>That said, I wish OpenACS&#8217;s testing facilities were better. I worked on a couple other bugs today and I&#8217;m trying really hard to write tests to expose bugs before fixing them, but it&#8217;s really a strain. Especially when you need to do a combination of black box and white box testing. I&#8217;d like to make testing easier in OpenACS, but I&#8217;m not sure if I have the brainpower :-)</p>

<p><b>Improving Testing</b></p>
<p>
Vinod,
</p>
<p>
There is definitely room for improvement. You can specify test
dependency, I think, so you can create a test package environment,
then run several tests using that setup. I haven&#8217;t tried that yet, but
it should help.
</p>
<p>
Anothing thing to keep in mind is that testing can expose places in
your code that might need to be decoupled. That is one of the
advantages of testing, by thinking of how to run the code is isolation
in the test, you can discover a better design :)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was looking at the <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/split.htm">Tcl 8.4 man page for &#8216;split&#8217;</a> and saw this example code:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='tcl'>## Split into fields on colons
set fields [split $rec &quot;:&quot;]
## Assign fields to variables and print some out...
lassign $fields userName password uid grp longName homeDir shell</code></pre>
</div>


<p>It shows how to split a string using &#8216;:&#8217; as the delimiter. The interesting part is the &#8216;lassign&#8217; statement. I&#8217;d never seen that before. I&#8217;ve always done something annoying like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='tcl'>set fields [split $rec &quot;:&quot;]
set userName [lindex $fields 0]
set password [lindex $fields 1]
set uid [lindex $fields 2]
set grp [lindex $fields 3]
set longName [lindex $fields 4]
set homeDir [lindex $fields 5]
set shell [lindex $fields 6]</code></pre>
</div>


<p>How could I have overlooked &#8216;lassign&#8217; all these years? After berating my idiocy for a few minutes, I tried &#8216;lassign&#8217; out and Tcl replied &#8216;invalid command name&#8217; . Turns out I&#8217;m not as stupid as I thought. :-) &#8216;lassign&#8217; is new in Tcl 8.5 (but seems to have snuck in the backdoor of the 8.4 docs). I decided to see what else was <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.5.html">coming in 8.5</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dictionaries. These are associative arrays which reportedly are better than Tcl arrays, but I&#8217;m not sure why.</li>
<li>** as an exponentiation operator</li>
<li>Instead of doing: <code>if {[lsearch -exact $list $item] != -1}</code>, the new &#8216;in&#8217; operator lets you do <code>if {$item in $list}</code>. There&#8217;s also a &#8216;ni&#8217; operator for &#8216;not in&#8217;.</li>
<li>Plenty of other stuff, none of which really caught my eye.</li>
</ul>


<p>Tcl 8.5 is still alpha, so I&#8217;m sticking with 8.4 (and my annoying
code) for the moment.</p>

<div id="comment-box">

<div class="one-comment">
<p><b>What about this</b></p>
<p>
Or just do
</p>

<pre><code>
foreach {userName password uid grp longName homeDir shell} [lrange fields 0 6] {break}
# We do an lrange here, otherwise values would be set wrong
# in case someone accidentally supplies a list with too many elements,
# because then the foreach loop would run more than once
</code></pre>
<p>
I just learned the lrange trick yesterday :)
</p>
<p>
I got caught by the over-optimistic 8.4 docs as well. lassign remove
the risk where you need to use the lrange call.

<p>We treated ourselves to our favorite New York Pizza today - Louie and
Ernie&#8217;s. In my mind, it&#8217;s the perfect pizza. The thin crust is crispy
on the bottom, and chewy on the top. There&#8217;s plenty of cheese and the
sauce has some flavor. The only problem with this place is that it&#8217;s
nowhere near public transportation and they don&#8217;t deliver. It&#8217;s
probably a good thing though, or we&#8217;d be eating this ALL the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Linux Journal featured an <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8986">article about a web application written in OpenACS</a>. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://fungoes.mek.cc/">Fungoes</a> and it tabulates and formats baseball statistics. If I had access to this app when I was a kid, I would&#8217;ve been in heaven. I remember spending hours and hours memorizing stats from the back of baseball cards. I&#8217;ve forgotten most of what I memorized, but I can still rattle off HR stats for most of the 1982 Brewers. This site really takes me back.</p>

<p>Fungoes is still in it&#8217;s early stages, but Mat apparently has big plans for it. It should be fun to watch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I built a web application to keep track of my running a couple years
ago. I really began using it in earnest during my training for the New
York Marathon last year. I&#8217;ve been meaning to make it available for
others to use for a long time, but it always seemed like there was a
little more work I needed to do on it. While working on it the other
day, I noticed the original timestamp on one of the source files:
<strong>September 21, 2003</strong> Yikes! That&#8217;s 2 and a half years ago. Enough is
enough &mdash; it&#8217;s time to let this baby free&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://kurup.org/run">Hit The Wall</a> is officially version 0.2 and
available for free use by anyone who wants to keep track of their
running. Feel free to look through <a href="http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=16832">my real log
(read-only)</a> or
<a href="http://kurup.org/run/log/log?runner_id=63350">demorunner&#8217;s fake log

Cool little tool Vinod, but after reading the reference on the Wall
and how to avoid it I have some alternative names:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t Hit The Wall - A Running Log</li>
<li>Avoiding The Wall - A Runner&#8217;s Log</li>
<li>Going Through Walls - Running Log</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Thanks Carl</b></p>
<p>
Good point. I just thought &#8216;Hit The Wall&#8217; sounded catchy. And it works
in the same vein as FSF&#8217;s text pager being named &#8216;less&#8217; (rather than
&#8216;more&#8217;). Get it? :-)
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, it&#8217;s better than the previous name I had in mind,
which was &#8216;Running Log&#8221;.
