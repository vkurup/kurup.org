  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I was a boy, I have been singing a song called &#8216;Daivame
Kaithozham&#8217;, which is pronounced &#8216;Dave-O-May Kie-Tho-Ram&#8217;. My parents
taught it to me when I was about 5 years old, so I learned it by
learning the syllables in the song. I know bits and pieces of
Malayalam, but not enough to know what the words of the song
mean. Whenever I&#8217;m feeling stressed, I sing it under my breath and it
makes me feel better. Kavi wasn&#8217;t the best sleeper as a baby, so we
spent a lot of time singing him back to sleep. Daivame Kaithozham was
one of my standbys and he has heard it literally thousands of
times. Even now, I sing it to him and Anika almost daily, though he
has requested that I cut it down to weekly. (He likes Laurie Berkner&#8217;s
&#8220;Moon, moon, moon&#8221; better. Oh well.) Both Anika and Kavi have heard it
enough that they can mimic me singing it, though they don&#8217;t know the
words&#8230;  mostly just the rhythm. But, it&#8217;s the cutest thing in the
world to see Anika pick up her doll, put it on the floor and start
singing &#8220;Daivame&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyway, I finally (after 30 something years) asked my parents what the
song means, so here is the translation. I&#8217;m not the most religious
person in the world, but if you replace God with whatever supernatural
force you believe in, I think it&#8217;s a nice simple prayer.</p>

<h2>Daivame Kaithozham</h2>

<p>   Daivame kaithozham kelkumarakanam <br />
   Pavamamenne nee kakkumarakanam <br />
   Ennullil bhaktiyundakumarakanam <br />
   Ninne jnanennume kanumarakanam <br /></p>

<p>   Nervazhikkenne nee kondupoyeedanam <br />
   Nervarum sankadam bhasmamayeedanam <br />
   Dushtasamsargam varatheyayeedanam <br />
   Shishtarayullavar thozharayeedanam <br /></p>

<p>   Nalla karyangalil premamundakanam <br />
   Nalla vakkothuvan thraniyundakanam <br />
   Kruthyangal cheyyuvan sradhayundakanam <br />
   Satyam paranjeedan saktiyundakana <br /></p>

<h2>Translated</h2>

<p>   O’Almighty God my humble salutation, may you kindly listen to my prayers <br />
   May you always protect this poor innocent one from all my sufferings. <br />
   May my devotion to you flourish in my heart without any interruptions <br />
   May I always visualize your eternal divine form within and without. <br /></p>

<p>   O’ God lead me through the right path  <br />
   Annihilate all obstructions facing me  <br />
   And protect me from evil interactions <br />
   Provide me with serene and sober friends. <br /></p>

<p>   May I always impart compassion and love to all <br />
   O’ Lord provide me courage to talk only good words <br />
   May I be provided with the right convictions to do my duties <br />
   And give me your blessed strength to tell always the truth alone. <br /></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I keep reading books about entrepreneurship. I like
the idea of building a business, having passion for something, and
most importantly, living life on your own terms. I just <a href="/blog/2010/11/07/growing-a-business">don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m cut out for it</a>. But see if
that will stop me from devouring <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker
News</a>, <a href="http://mixergy.com">startup
podcasts</a> and books like <a href="http://sivers.org">Derek Sivers&#8217;</a> <a href="http://t.co/rdADtHa">Anything
You
Want</a>.</p>

<p>Derek was a musician who started selling his own CDs online in the
days before Paypal. He agreed to help a friend by selling his friend&#8217;s
CDs as well, and eventually CD Baby was born. He built it into a
successful business and sold it for $22 million. This book is a set of
stories of how that happened. An <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/57644/Anything-You-Want-21-Inspiring-Ideas-From-Derek-Sivers.aspx">excellent bullet point
summary</a>
of the book is available. This short book was filled with interesting
advice and stories, but here&#8217;s my main takeaways.</p>

<h3>Focus on helping people</h3>

<p>It would seem like the way to build a successful business would be to
focus on things like profits, or markets, or costs, but Derek says to
ignore all that and focus on helping people. He started by helping out
a fellow musician, and he made sure that every decision he made was in
the name of helping independent musicians. If big labels asked to be
added to CD Baby, he said no. If people recommended placing ads on his
site, he said no. If a business offered some kind of big money
partnership which required him to change the way he ran his business,
he said no. Find someone you can help and provide enough value to that
person to make them happy to pay you for the help and you will have a
successful business.</p>

<h3>Make something perfect, not big</h3>

<blockquote><p>So, I thought that by taking an unrealistically utopian approach, I could keep the business from growing too much. Instead of trying to make it big, I was going to make it small. It was the opposite of ambition, so I had to think in a way that was the opposite of ambitious.</p>

<p>The key point is that I wasn&#8217;t trying to make a big business. I was just daydreaming about how one little thing would look in a perfect world.</p></blockquote>

<p>Derek actively tried to keep his business from growing. At some point,
he was making enough money that he felt the growth of the business
would only create more headaches for him. Instead of trying to get
more business, he would try to make his current business
perfect. Focus on ways to make the business run the way you want the
world to work. Build your utopia. If you are always focused on growing
the business, you eventually have to make compromises between what
your current customers want and what &#8220;potential&#8221; customers want. But,
if your current customers are the ones who you&#8217;re passionate about
serving, then making their experience even better will paradoxically
bring growth, while also making your life as a business owner more
fulfilling.</p>

<h3>This book is not about business</h3>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s important to know in advance, to make sure you&#8217;re staying focused on what&#8217;s honestly important to you, instead of doing what others think you should.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s really a book about life. Focus on helping people and good things
will happen to you. Figure out what makes you tick, what makes you
happy, and what drains you. Adjust your life to give you more time to
do what makes you happy and stop doing the things that drain
you. Derek&#8217;s rule about this is &#8220;HELL, YEAH!&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;. If someone
offers you an opportunity and you don&#8217;t say &#8220;HELL, YEAH!&#8221;, then say
&#8220;no&#8221;. Don&#8217;t go halfway. Do things that you love. (His actual rule is a
little more &#8216;explicit&#8217;, as he describes in this
<a href="http://mixergy.com/derek-sivers-blog-interview/">podcast</a>)</p>

<h3>A few other quotes that I loved</h3>

<br>


<h5>Getting things done isn&#8217;t the only goal</h5>

<blockquote><p>[Other people] assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way. But that&#8217;s forgetting about the joy of learning and doing.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Know thyself</h5>

<blockquote><p>Just pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you. Pay close attention to when you&#8217;re being the real you and when you&#8217;re trying to impress the invisible jury.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Unexpected twist</h5>

<blockquote><p>So I considered firing everyone and hiring a whole new crew. &#8230; I never saw or spoke to my employees again. Never saw the office again.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wasn&#8217;t expecting to read that. Thought that he would find a way to
patch things up, but stuff like this happens in the real world.</p>

<h3>How to do customer service</h3>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t from the book, but was in a <a href="http://mixergy.com/derek-sivers-blog-interview/">great Mixergy
interview</a> that I
heard after finishing the book. He describes his customer service
philosophy as the <strong>Mick Jagger philosophy</strong>. Pretend that every customer
service request you get is from Mick Jagger. (Assuming your company is
in the music business). If someone emails you a request about how they
can&#8217;t access a PDF file on your site, that might seem like an annoying
complaint. But if you pretend that it&#8217;s coming from Mick Jagger, you&#8217;d
respond &#8220;Wow, thanks for emailing me. Here, let me just get that PDF
for you and attach it to this email. Again, please let me know if
there&#8217;s anything else I can do for you!&#8221; And if that is heartfelt,
customers will love you.</p>

<h3>Bottom line</h3>

<p>I enjoyed this book. It&#8217;s a quick read, it&#8217;s cheap (I read the Kindle
version on my Android tablet for $7.99) and it&#8217;s inspirational. I
<a href="http://t.co/rdADtHa">recommend it</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sorry, but I just can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been almost 10 years since I
left Boston. Mala had a meeting there and we love to take advantage of
our employers&#8217; generosity <a href="Makes">^1</a>, so I TrippedIt <a href="Is">^2</a> back to Boston for
some nostalgia with 2 kids in tow (Ages 4 and 2). Buildings and
restaurants have come and gone <a href="Where">^3</a>, but it seems like so little has
changed in 10+ years. I forgot how &#8220;unfriendly&#8221; the city was. The trip
was a few weeks ago, so it&#8217;s not fresh in my mind anymore, but I
remember thinking that vividly while I was there. You get the sense
that everyone has their shields up (or their guns drawn, to mix
metaphors) for whatever reason. None of the experiences were horrible,
but it was little things&#8230; Bathrooms are &#8220;broken&#8221; in every fast food
restaurant. Restaurants have arcane rules: &#8220;No, we only do takeout
after 3PM&#8221; or &#8220;Cash Only - there&#8217;s an ATM over there&#8221;. Customer
service people must be groomed to be rude. We&#8217;re members of the
(AWESOME!)  <a href="http://www.ncmls.org/">Durham Museum of Life and Science</a>
which gives us free entry to science museums around the country, so we
walked up to the Members desk at Boston&#8217;s version (Museum of Science)
and promptly got lectured about how we weren&#8217;t really members and next
time we should go in the Nonmembers line. (Um, we&#8217;re visiting from
North Carolina&#8230; there&#8217;s probably not going to be a next time anytime
soon). I actually turned around and looked at all of the people behind
me and apologized for our rudeness. Wait! There was no one else
waiting! Just makes you feel small, which burns me up, because I know
that was her objective. I know none of that seems all that bad, but
that general attitude seemed prevalent and brought back memories of
Boston that I had repressed. We all had a great time in Boston, but I
am so glad that I&#8217;m living in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Wow, that little interlude took me from excited to depressed in no
time flat. Enough of that. Let&#8217;s talk about the fun stuff we did. We
always research on the web to get a sense of things Kavi and Anika
might like. I had trouble finding good first-person stories about
<strong>Boston trips with little kids</strong>, so here&#8217;s mine, in case someone has 2
kids exactly like ours. If this is useful, or if you have stuff to
add, please leave a comment or point to your blog.</p>

<h3>Things the kids loved:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Being in Boston: &#8220;We&#8217;re in BOSTON!&#8221;</li>
<li>Walking the streets and seeing all kinds of vehicles: Taxis, buses,
trolleys, Ducks, police cars, and most excitingly, Minivans!.
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/74NPRUFqKCQ7b1UdhOcphw?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-udiiy9uwK0I/Tf_Cs_JZjSI/AAAAAAAAStM/idfT4DGvVIg/s400/IMG_1819.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/exhibits/mapparium">Mapparium</a> at Mary Baker Eddy Library:
Kavi talked about this a lot for the rest of the trip, but at the
time didn&#8217;t seem all that impressed by it. He was intrigued by the
fact that I wasn&#8217;t allowed to take pictures inside it. He also liked
the Hall of Ideas and the computerized art programs upstairs.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bostoncentral.com/activities/parks/p2055.php">Boston Common Carousel</a>:
It&#8217;s a carousel. Of course they loved it!
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/m-xAmdHOY3Oj7RLV7GqrfQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VHxkS2HOz98/Tf_CIWq5aBI/AAAAAAAASn0/4OkxOELTRkM/s400/IMG_1565.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.swanboats.com/">Swan boats</a>:
Definitely a must-do. It&#8217;s short and sweet.
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/b3pFVNPd_qZN9f2aAxkOMg?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fr-r42kU5Jk/Tf_CPpJ_PLI/AAAAAAAASo8/sShUbKnk9ak/s400/IMG_1633.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.schon.com/public/ducklings-boston.php">Ducklings in the Garden</a>:
Dressed in Bruins outfits while we were there. Those poor ducks were
constantly surrounded by little ones.
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gzG8lLrumqPoaaDWT89pCQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JXMBbVQC5ss/Tf_B6IyTv-I/AAAAAAAASl4/EYX2c4gS4vI/s400/IMG_1483.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li>Boston Commons and Garden:
There&#8217;s plenty of stuff for the kids to see and do here, but they&#8217;re not so big that you&#8217;ll get lost (think Central Park).
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mAwQUzWgDQJEPExhJnUA4A?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Rdh48Xnk-14/Tf_CcSdfDBI/AAAAAAAASqY/29JAz9fhlcA/s400/IMG_1705.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://gocitykids.parentsconnect.com/attraction/boston-common-playground-boston-common-boston-ma-02111-us">Boston Commons Playground</a>:
Every parent on a trip knows that step one is finding all the local
playgrounds. This is a nice one and was close to the hotel. That
meets all the necessary requirements. By the way, while putting this
post together, I found this nice listing of <a href="http://gocitykids.parentsconnect.com/sub-category/boston-ma-usa/places-to-go/outdoors/playgrounds">playgrounds in Boston</a>.</li>
<li>Playground on Tremont:
We found a much smaller playground between the Hotel and NEMC that
Kavi and Anika liked a little better, mostly because they had it all
to themselves.</li>
<li>Playgrounds on the Charles River:
Take the bridge over to the Hatch shell, go left (west) and walk for
about half a mile. Nestled between Storrow Drive and the Charles
River, there&#8217;s plenty to watch and play with. Kavi and Anika really
liked the little car. Oh, and if you happen to go right (east)
instead of left, there&#8217;s a great playground near the tennis
courts, which is on the way to the Museum of Science. <br>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VU9ZILbVTM3WjUQf8ewOVA?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZyXEp8eIv8E/Tf_CXQ8c-II/AAAAAAAASp0/RwBruXMUjrI/s400/IMG_1675.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hatchshell.com/">Hatch shell</a>:
There was an AIDS race while we were there which meant lots of people and
balloons to keep the kids occupied. I heard it gets crazy on July
4th :-)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mos.org/">Museum of Science</a>:
Aside from the annoying registration employee, this was fun. The
<a href="http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/current_exhibits&amp;d=233">Discovery
Center</a>
didn&#8217;t open for an hour, so we explored the regular museum
first. Most of it was above Kavi and Anika&#8217;s age level, so they were
getting bored/overwhelmed. The Discovery Center was better, though we
didn&#8217;t find the best part (the upstairs level) until near the end of
our stay. Kavi&#8217;s favorite thing was watching the pneumatic tube
system. The volunteers up there were really engaging as well. <br>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6tj5VGYyO33R1oOoJJII2A?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-92-8sBu_bEI/Tf_CxW7oNaI/AAAAAAAASuI/0kfvbLMTSvo/s400/IMG_1864.JPG" height="400" width="300" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bostonkids.org/exhibits.html">Children&#8217;s Museum</a>:
The museum with the &#8220;rabbit sitting on top&#8221; and the big milk
bottle on the side. Predictably loved by Kavi and Anika.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.neaq.org">New England Aquarium</a>:
The kids were underwhelmed. They liked the
<a href="http://www.vanaqua.org/">Vancouver</a> and
<a href="http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/">Atlanta</a> ones more. We spent most
of our time in the toddler area playing with toys that are normally
found in doctors&#8217; waiting rooms. I think they&#8217;ll love this in a
couple years. <br>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UloiGxYpoMj-eJQ62shPrQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GfsPi7jlpUE/Tf_BztUhHBI/AAAAAAAASlU/-iCxRKEUIMs/s400/IMG_1451.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://mbta.com">The T</a>:
We could have just ridden the T every day. It was loud, which freaks
Kavi out a bit, but not as loud as New York. We rode on the blue
line to get to the aquarium, and the Green line to come back to the
Hotel. He especially liked the Green line because the &#8220;floor turns&#8221;. <br>

<li><a href="http://www.bostonparkplaza.com/">Park Plaza</a>:
A decent hotel. Living mostly on reputation and location. I guess
we&#8217;ve been spoiled by modern hotels in other cities, so the Park
Plaza seemed dingy and overpriced. But the location is awesome, work was
paying for it, and our kids love any hotels, so I recommend it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dining:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Vapiano (pseudo-italian restaurant where Bennigan&#8217;s used to be):
The kids liked their pastas and like sitting at the little tables.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jaescafe.com/">Jae&#8217;s Cafe</a>:
Not really a kids thing, but we went early on a weeknight and had a
really nice dinner. They have &#8220;training&#8221; chopsticks that the kids loved.

<li><a href="http://www.mikescitydiner.com/">Mike&#8217;s City Diner</a>: (Ouch, Flashy website)
Our first breakfast stop and we returned a few days later which is a
huge endorsement. Avoid it on weekends though, because it&#8217;s
packed. Cash only. <br>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HSbAj63Z9vcSgMhKWbkVmQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MF8LJX6QkDM/Tf_B846X18I/AAAAAAAASmQ/ad_LUNxHneQ/s288/IMG_1505.JPG" height="216" width="288" /></a>

<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/charlies-sandwich-shoppe-boston">Charlie&#8217;s Sandwich Shoppe</a>:
Another great breakfast place. We went on Kavi&#8217;s birthday and were
just about the only ones in the restaurant, so the entire staff sang
Happy Birthday and put a candle on his pancake. He was so
thrilled. Cash only.
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gjT3uIvumJMC2YNhJRXzpg?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zox0d2diKaM/Tf_Ckj9fGrI/AAAAAAAASr0/eBk3nvUaKUM/s400/IMG_1747.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li>Legal Seafood:
Quick dinner after arriving from the airport. Not the most kid
friendly place, but aside from a long wait, it was fine.
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oDgdkVHgyvxeagZs3GIhjw?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4XoWN5kwIzE/Tf_BvZu_TVI/AAAAAAAASks/gPpBjKpnWoc/s400/IMG_1421.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li>Dunkin Donuts:
Nostalgic coffee and donuts, but NO BATHROOMS!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-garden-boston">Asian Garden</a>:
The best salt &amp; pepper squid that I have ever had. Still as good as
I remember it 15 years ago! <br>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bUxOVG-Gxd9RUfydEzit9Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7kdUE3ux_Uc/Tf_B8KQJ1sI/AAAAAAAASmI/GDK1-ESwPxY/s400/IMG_1500.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li>Dim Sum at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/hei-la-moon-boston">Hei La Moon</a>:
Mala was at her meeting, Anika was asleep and Kavi was sick, so only
I got to enjoy this luxury.
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4LTUcmjuT_01BGLu-dXjzg?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nob5EC9E9kk/Tf_Ce-ukRXI/AAAAAAAASqw/WiNBBq-RoJ0/s400/IMG_1722.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li>North End (Boston&#8217;s Little Italy):
We went to visit Mala&#8217;s friends and had great take out. The walk
from the Park Plaza was nice, since it crossed the Garden, the
government center area and the North End, all of which had sights
that the kids enjoyed</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/croissant-du-jour-boston">Croissant Du Jour</a>:
Great breakfast food and sandwiches.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.finaledesserts.com/">Finale</a>:
We went here for Kavi&#8217;s birthday dessert. Nowhere near as good as I
remember it being, but that might be because Mala is just an amazing
cook, so my standards have risen. <br>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/yagEwh3QcBswOTq0D_O1ZQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img class="inset" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M2Kx1_dLj0k/Tf_CwshBY8I/AAAAAAAASuA/y3DDBygZ1pU/s400/IMG_1835.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.parishcafe.com/index2.html">Parish Cafe</a>:
Sandwiches are awesome! We went there on Monday, which is the day
that we eat only veggies, so I couldn&#8217;t try the Regis that I used to
love. The bread, though, was enough to satisfy my cravings. Sit
outside and the kids will be entertained by the constant traffic and
activity on Boylston Street.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Useful Android Apps:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.yelp.android">Yelp</a>:
I downloaded a bunch of other ones including AAA Triptik, Tripadvisor,
HopStop, but I ended up using Yelp and Google Maps predominantly.</li>
<li><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.tripit">TripIt</a>:
Not specific to Boston, but this app makes traveling easier. Keeps
track of all your flight info, hotel info and any other itinerary info
you want to stick into it.</li>
</ul>


<p>End result of the trip: Success!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I talked yesterday about how I didn&#8217;t like the Google Listen podcast
client. I did a little Googling and found a nice solution (somewhat
ironic, in an Alanis Morrissette kinda way):
<a href="http://www.doggcatcher.com/">Doggcatcher</a>. It costs $6.99 and I spent
an extra $3.99 for <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.aocate.presto">Presto Sound
Library</a>
which allows you to speed up the podcasts a little. Sorry Merlin! (He
hates when people do this). Doggcatcher seems to do everything I
mentioned as requirements in yesterday&#8217;s post. I also like that it
doesn&#8217;t sync between clients, so I can have audio podcasts on my phone
and video podcasts on my gtab tablet. It has a million configuration
options, so you can set certain podcasts as higher priority than
others and you can define how many episodes should be downloaded per
podcast. I love having that kind of flexibility. Most importantly, the
UI has been understandable and every time I launch it, I&#8217;m placed
right back at the same place that I left off when I quit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the years I&#8217;ve been listening to podcasts, I&#8217;ve only found 2
podcast clients that I&#8217;ve really liked: iTunes (back around 2005-2007)
and a bash script that I wrote which simply copied files downloaded by
<a href="http://podget.sourceforge.net/">podget</a> onto my iPod nano. <a href="http://listen.googlelabs.com/">Google
Listen</a> on my Droid X (Android 2.2) is
tolerable, but only barely. I think my requirements are simple. I want
to put in URLs and have the client get all the podcasts in that URL
and stick them in a queue. I want the client to refresh every N hours
and add new files to the queue. I want the client to automatically
download each file in the queue. Once I listen to a file, I want the
client to delete it from my device. I&#8217;d like a configurable option to
be able to save a file, while I&#8217;m listening to it, so if I am
listening to something that I want to hear again, I hit a save button
and it won&#8217;t automatically be deleted. If I don&#8217;t like an episode, I&#8217;d
like to hit &#8216;next&#8217; to have that podcast deleted and the next one
started. Finally, I want some statistics about which podcasts I&#8217;m
listening to, which ones I&#8217;m skipping, and then some suggestions about
which podcasts I might like. A product from Google should be able to
do this. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t reliably tell which podcasts I&#8217;m
subscribed to. There is a &#8216;subscribe&#8217; button in each one, and when I
click it, it changes to &#8216;unsubscribe&#8217;, but then when I back out and
come back, it says &#8216;subscribe&#8217; again, so I&#8217;m not sure if I am
subscribed or unsubscribed. When I subscribe, the podcasts show up in
Google Reader, and I don&#8217;t want them there. I understand the idea of
reusing Google Reader since it is a RSS/Atom reader, but I never
listen to podcasts on my computer. I don&#8217;t know what happens if I mark
something as read in Google Reader. Does that mean it won&#8217;t show up in
Listen? I haven&#8217;t figured it out. Each time I start Listen, it seems
that a different podcast starts, rather than starting where I left
off. Well, it&#8217;s inconsistent. Sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn&#8217;t. Skipping a podcast doesn&#8217;t delete it, although there is a
config option for that. Maybe I&#8217;m just doing it wrong. Most
annoyingly, it doesn&#8217;t automatically download all the podcasts, so
when one finishes, I have to wait for the next one to start buffering
and if I&#8217;m driving and I happen to be in a poor 3G service area, that
might take a while. Maybe this should be my first Android project?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My commute to work is 25 minutes each way, so I&#8217;m always looking for a
podcast to listen to. I&#8217;ve been a fan of the
<a href="http://43folders.com">43folders</a> website for years and Merlin Mann
recently started a podcast called <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back To Work</a>
with Dan Benjamin. Dan Benjamin, it turns out, is the founder of a
network called <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a>, which he says has been called
&#8220;NPR for geeks&#8221;. The shows I&#8217;ve listened to have all been sharp and
entertaining so far. I especially like <a href="http://5by5.tv/paleo/16">Latest in
Paleo</a> (despite the fact that I&#8217;m not eating
anything near a Paleo diet) and the Pipeline (check out the interview
with <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/49">Philip Elmer-DeWitt</a>). Looking
through the list of shows, I can only believe that Dan Benjamin has to
be the most productive person on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently also listening to <a href="http://twit.tv/aaa">All About
Android</a>, <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American
Life</a> and some <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978271">UC-Berkeley CS
lectures</a>. Any
other great podcasts I&#8217;m missing?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this great github project. It&#8217;s just a <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">list of .gitignore
files</a> for various languages and
platforms, but it&#8217;s nice to have them all in one place. The
<code>.gitignore</code> file is, like it sounds, a list of files or directories
that you don&#8217;t want to be included in version control. For Android,
for example, the <code>bin/</code> and <code>gen/</code> directories are generated each time
you compile, so you don&#8217;t want to include that. Especially, as <a href="/blog/2011/05/16/android-resourcesnotfoundexception/">I
learned</a>,
because it will give you errors when you run a project created on one
computer, on a different computer. The Android <code>.gitignore</code> from
github unfortunately didn&#8217;t have <code>bin/</code> or <code>gen/</code> (or
<code>local.properties</code>) in there, so I put them in and was about to send
them a pull request, when I found someone else had made the same
changes a few days ago already. Which makes me feel better that I was
on the right path. Go Open Source!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some (unorganized) thoughts about my experience at the
Society of Hospital Medicine (SHM) 2011 conference in Dallas, TX.</p>

<h3>Opening Plenary</h3>

<p>The initial presentation dissected the SHM Annual Compensation survey,
discussing regional variations in pay and work effort over time. I
understand the importance of that stuff, but ever since I got my first
$638.36 paycheck as an intern, money hasn&#8217;t been an issue for me.</p>

<p>The second talk was by <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Robert_Kocher">Bob
Kocher</a>, an Obama
insider during the recent healthcare reformd. Gerry would have loved
this one. He briefly described how a bill becomes a law&#8230; it
apparently doesn&#8217;t follow the Schoolhouse Rock model anymore. At one
point, reform looked dead, when the Catholic Nuns came out in favor of
the legislation allowing multiple congress members to change their
vote to &#8220;Yes&#8221;. As Kocher put it (paraphrasing), &#8220;When the Nuns broke
with the Bishops, healthcare reform could move forward.&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t that
seem like a statement that should be in a history book about medieval
times, rather than a statement about 2010 United States politics?
Maybe it&#8217;s just me&#8230;</p>

<h3>Neurologic emergencies</h3>

<p>The Neurologic emergencies talk was entertaining, though maybe more
useful to an intensivist. David Likosky is hilarious in a geeky kind
of way. A few things I learned:</p>

<p>Always maintain a good differential diagnosis and don&#8217;t jump to a
conclusion too quickly. He described a case of an alcoholic who
presented in coma and had dynamic pupils making a brainstem stroke the
most likely diagnosis. A lot of time was spent to rule that out, and
then his labs came back with a sugar of 13, indicating that the
diagnosis of hypoglycemia was missed. He described some of the reasons
that happened and I can see them happening to me. Never get fixated on
a diagnosis, especially before you&#8217;ve made the proper initial
evaluaation. A fingerstick glucose should always be done in a coma
workup.</p>

<p>A few points on status epilepticus (SE)</p>

<ul>
<li>Convulsive SE is a seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes, and is a medical
emergency.</li>
<li>Lorazepam is probably better than Diazepam and don&#8217;t be
afraid to use high doses (Start at 4 IV). We commonly underdose and
underdosing hurts.</li>
<li>Nonconvulsive SE is considered as a medical urgency. A lot of
patients have SE on EEG after convulsions have stopped and many have
persistent subclinical seizures after SE is controlled. So, repeat the
EEG, and consider transfer to a center that can do continuous EEG monitoring.</li>
<li>Absence seizures is really a diagnosis of children. (Not really
about SE, but interesting)</li>
</ul>


<p>Things to make you think that a CVA may be posterior circulation: Loss
of consciousness, pupillary abnormalities, superhigh BP. Allow it to
stay superhigh and keep the patient flat. Because posterior
circulation strokes have such bad outcomes, it&#8217;s OK to intervene after
the normal time window if there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any other hope.</p>

<h3>Dermatology images (Paul Aronowitz)</h3>

<p>When approaching a rash, ask 3 questions: Did the patient cause this
rash? Did we do that to the patient? (Ask this twice). Is this rash a
manifestation of some other disease? We often jump to the third
question, but should consider the first two.</p>

<p>The snake bite risk factors are pretty interesting:
- Male
- Age 17-27
- Deliberate attempt to handle, harm or kill snake
- Summer months
- Alcohol intoxication
- Tattoos</p>

<p>DRESS (Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) usually
occurs 2-6 weeks after the drug is started, but occurs quicker after
rechallenge with the drug.</p>

<p>Reactive arthritis can be seen after Clostridium difficile infections.</p>

<p>20% of cases of Neisseria meningitidis do not have meningitis.</p>

<h3>Poster presentations</h3>

<p>The poster presentations are always fun to read, though if I see one
more poster about the readmission problem, I will vomit.</p>

<h3>Research Abstract Awards</h3>

<p>The winning research abstracts were very interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li>UCSF described changes that they made to meet new ACGME requirements
while decreasing costs and improving certain quality measures.</li>
<li><p>Johns Hopkins hospitalists modified their CPOE system to show the
costs of specific lab tests, hoping to change provider behavior. They
were able to show that providers ordered less tests when they saw the
cost. Duh, you say, but there is so little cost information available
to providers, so this is innovative if only for that reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Hospitalists (in Colorado, I think?) used the Toyota Production
System to model problems with current intern work schedules. They then
reworked the schedule to minimize waste of resident resources, while
improving continuity and resident satisfaction. They were able to
basically eliminate moonlighter and jeopardy use. I didn&#8217;t understand
the schedule because it was presented quickly, but I like the idea of
taking a nonmedical thought approach and applying it to medicine. I
also like that they optimized for continuity of care, so that after
the intervention there was a huge increase in the amount of patients
that were seen only by 1 intern during their stay. Very interesting!</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>SHM promotion</h3>

<p>My attention faded during the award presentations and SHM motivational
speeches, but Joseph Li, the incoming SHM president, did come clean
and acknowledge that he was born outside the U.S., despite his lack of
an accent. The birthers were right!</p>

<h3>Geographic rounding</h3>

<p>Emory Hospitalists then presented a talk which was titled &#8216;Utilizing
Technology to Improve Clinical and Operational Performance of
Hospitalists&#8217; but it should really have been titled &#8220;Geographic
Bedside Rounds: Just Do It!&#8221;. They did mention the IT improvements
they&#8217;ve made to support geographic rounding, but the value of the talk
was in describing how they implemented geographic rounding and how it
has been received by the involved parties. Moving to geographic
rounding helps providers the least. It&#8217;s basically an addition to our
workload. On the other hand, patients, nurses, and social workers get
a lot of benefit and obviously, the patients are the most important
factor here. We will have to see the patient more than once and our
workflow will have to change, but it seems that the benefits outweigh
the extra costs to the individual provider. Paraphrased, &#8220;Nurses and
social workers would riot if we stopped this system, but even
hospitalists wouldn&#8217;t want to go back to the old way, if put to a
referendum.&#8221; Something that only came out in the post-talk questions
was how this has improved overall teamwork. They used to have a
complicated system about how new admissions were assigned, taking into
account census numbers, discharge numbers, and other factors. Now,
with the new system, there are days that one hospitalist will have
completely unequal numbers or new patients than another hospitalist,
but it is understood that things will even out over time. That has
encouraged hospitalists to stop focusing on numbers and instead to
focus on making things run better, so hospitalists who were previously
&#8220;anti-teamwork&#8221; are now offering to help out when they&#8217;re done with
their work. Anecdotal, but I like stories like that.</p>

<p>They also mentioned that they created a video dramatization of their
bedside rounds. If I can find it, I will link to it.</p>

<h3>Updates in Hospital Medicine</h3>

<ul>
<li>Oral prednisone 60 mg daily as good as 600 mg IV for COPD
exacerbation (Presented at DRH Journal club)</li>
<li>OK to extend peripheral IVs rather than change routinely (Emailed to
me by DRH Hospitalist)</li>
<li>Getting appts for COPD exacerbation pts within 30 days may decrease
rehospitalization (duh!)</li>
<li>Benefit for tPA in stroke up to 4.5 hours, but earlier is better
(DRH Journal club)</li>
<li>Gurgling sounds predict pneumonia and ICU transfer (duh)</li>
<li>Routine ID consultation in Staph aureus bacteremia significantly
improves mortality (HR 0.44) (NEW TO ME)</li>
<li>Coagulopathy in liver disease doesn&#8217;t protect against VTE (duh)</li>
<li>Metformin does not cause lactic acidosis (old news, but nice to be
data-supported now)</li>
<li>Enteral nutrition better than TPN in pancreatitis (DRH email/conversations)</li>
<li>In ICU palliative care situations, only 47% of family members based
their survival estimates on MD&#8217;s prognosis advice.</li>

<p>I skipped the ICU stuff. Only one of these updates was new to me
(listed as NEW in the list above). I attribute that to my colleagues
at Durham Regional who have been sharing the knowledge that they&#8217;ve
been collecting from various meetings and readings this year.</p>

<h3>Careers in Academic Medicine</h3>

<p>This was a workshop on how to pursue your ideal life in academic
medicine. I loved the energy and enthusiasm of the instructors. This
probably would&#8217;ve benefited from being a longer course with fewer,
more involved participants. The basic premise was to document what
exactly you are doing now, what you&#8217;re getting paid to do, and what
you enjoy doing. Reconcile the differences in those 3 lists and try to
identify how to make them match.</p>

<h3>No wireless</h3>

<p>This would have been posted a lot earlier if I could ever get on the
SHM wireless network at the Gaylord Convention Center. &#8220;Please
wait. You will be redirected to the authentication page in 5 seconds.&#8221;
You lie!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://amzn.to/m8SK61"><img class="inset right" src="/images/learning-android.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/m8SK61">Learning
Android</a>. I have a Droid X, Mala has a Droid
Eris, and I just bought a Viewsonic g-tablet, so I have plenty of
Android devices. While I still have trouble with the idea of typing on
a touchscreen, I know that we are moving towards a future where mobile
devices are our primary computers. This is not earth
shattering. <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/business/mobile-phone-as-home-computer">Philip Greenspun mentioned it 5 years
ago</a>. Android
will be <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/04/25/Mobility">one of the more prominent mobile
OS&#8217;s</a>
along with iOS, so I want to learn how to program it.</p>

<p>I came into this book having browsed some of the example code on the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/">developer.android.com</a> website. It is
great for an overview, and there is a lot of in-depth information on
APIs, etc., but I still didn&#8217;t quite understand how to go about
starting an app.</p>

<p>In March, O&#8217;Reilly had a sale on e-books, so I bought <a href="http://amzn.to/m8SK61">Learning
Android</a>. It is a reasonable introduction to
Android programming. It&#8217;s beings gently, explaining the history of
Android and providing a general overview of how the Android stack
works. It&#8217;s explains how to use the Eclipse IDE, but as a fervent
emacs fan, I was easily able to adjust to using emacs (with
<a href="https://github.com/remvee/android-mode">android-mode.el</a>) for all of
my development. There were typos and minor errors, but fortunately
<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/errataunconfirmed.csp?isbn=0636920010883">O&#8217;Reilly has an errata
page</a>
where people can post fixes and suggestions. Keep that page open while
you&#8217;re reading this book. There were a couple areas where the ordering
of the discussion could have been improved. If I didn&#8217;t have that
errata page at hand, I would have been completely
frustrated. Especially at the beginning, the instructions were not
detailed enough. For example, we are instructed on how to create a
program and how to start the emulator, but there is no clear
explanation on how to run the program on the emulator. A little more
step-by-step hand-holding would have been nice.</p>

<p>In case you ignored my advice to check out that errata page, at least
make sure that you have the updated version of the <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/0636920010883/README-JTwitter-Library.txt">jTwitter
library</a>,
or else you&#8217;ll never get the sample programs to run without errors.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t used Java in a while, so I forgot how verbose Java
is. Writing Tcl, Ruby and Python has spoiled me. It takes so long to
do something simple in Java. I know that this is usually offset by
code generators and IDEs, but it still just seems so clunky to read
and write. There is a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">scripting language project for Android
(SL4A)</a>. I haven&#8217;t tried
it, but it involves bundling the scripting environment with your app
if you want to distribute it to others. I&#8217;m also not certain that it
provides access to all of the functionality provided in the Java SDK.
Someday, I hope that a scripting language SDK is provided. It seems
like a natural progression.</p>

<p>All in all, I think Learning Android is perfect for someone who wants
to get started in Android programming. It gives a nice gentle
introduction to all of the basics of how the platform works. Most of
this information is available on the web in various places, but it&#8217;s
nice to have it all in one place, and I still think there&#8217;s value to
having one book that takes you from step zero to a working app. I
think I&#8217;ll now be able to use the online docs to get me moving. I was
often frustrated by the typos, minor technical errors and
inconsistencies, but I suspect the book was under a lot of time
pressure, given how hot mobile programming is these days. It just felt
like it was written on a rushed deadline. It&#8217;s also not the most
entertaining book in the world, which is OK for a technical book. I&#8217;d
always rather have a boring technical book, than an <em>attempt</em> at an
entertaining one.</p>
