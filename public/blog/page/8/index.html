  <div class="entry-content"><p>As mentioned yesterday, I&#8217;m teaching myself clojure. I started by trying to
install it.</p>

<pre><code>vinod@ike$ aptitude install clojure
</code></pre>

<p>Ubuntu has packaged version 1.0.0 of clojure. I always default to the
OS-installed version of programs, just for ease of maintenance. The current
stable version of clojure is 1.1 and it appears that 1.2 is in beta. I have
no idea what has been changed in 1.1 or 1.2, but I&#8217;m going to try to get
along using 1.0.0 and update only if I need to for a specific reason.</p>

<p>I then read through the
<a href="http://www.moxleystratton.com/article/clojure/for-non-lisp-programmers">tutorial for non-lisp programmers</a>,
which succinctly describes the basics of the language.<a href="I">^1</a> Everything in
lisp is either an atom or a list. Atoms include numbers, booleans, strings,
symbols, keywords and the nil value. Lists (delimited by parentheses <code>()</code>)
are the basic data structure, but include representations such as vectors
(delimited by square brackets <code>[]</code>) and maps (delimited by curly brackets
<code>{}</code>). Clojure programs are themselves simply lists, which leads to the
power of lisp-like languages because code and data are interchangeable.</p>

<p>You use <code>def</code> to create variables and <code>defn</code> to create functions. The
language includes loops and conditional statements, just like any other
useful language. Only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are <em>false</em> in clojure; zero (0),
and the empty string (&#8220;&#8221;) are <em>true</em>, unlike a lot of languages.</p>

<p>The interesting part is the integration with Java. To instantiate a java
object, simply call <code>new</code>:</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (new java.util.Date)
#&lt;Date Sun Jul 18 16:20:54 EDT 2010&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To call object methods or get instance/class variables, use the dot &#8220;.&#8221;
method.</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (. (new java.util.Date) (toString))
"Sun Jul 18 16:24:09 EDT 2010"

user=&gt; (. Integer MAX_VALUE)
2147483647
</code></pre>

<p>The article contains this interesting quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sequences are in a sense, the core of idiomatic Clojure
programming. Understand sequences and the forms that work with them, and
you will have cleared one of the biggest hurdles in writing significant
Clojure programs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, add that to my to-do list. Where to go next? A
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/599519/which-tutorial-on-clojure-is-best">StackOverflow thread</a>
has pointed to me to a few options. I&#8217;ll probably read one of these next:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Yegge is one of my favorite bloggers. I read <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">&#8220;You Should Write
Blogs&#8221;</a> a
long time ago and it is one of the main reasons that I still try to keep
this blog going at all. He recently took a blogging hiatus and in his
<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2010/07/blogger-finger.html">return post</a>,
he left a little hint that he was interested in a programming language
called <a href="http://clojure.org">clojure</a>.</p>

<p>My programming skills have been rusting away (Darn those patients, always
getting sick and stuff!), so I&#8217;ve been looking for a little
inspiration. I&#8217;m hoping that clojure is it. I&#8217;ve always wanted to learn
lisp. I know a little elisp and scheme, but I&#8217;ve never gotten comfortable
with them. Clojure compiles code that runs on a JVM (java virtual
machine). This gives you a lot of the &#8220;power&#8221; of java, namely the extensive
libraries and the widespread platforms on which it will run. But instead of
having to write java, you get to write in a dynamic, lisp-like language. At
least that&#8217;s how I understand it.</p>

<p>Specifically, I hope that I&#8217;ll eventually be able to create applications
that run on android phones, which is a java environment. Smartphones are
clearly going to be a huge part of the future, if not <strong>the way</strong> of the
future. I don&#8217;t see myself ever buying an iPhone and Mala already has a
Droid Eris that I&#8217;d be able to play with if I needed. (Didn&#8217;t tell you
that, did I Mala?) So&#8230; Android it is.</p>

<p>Starting today, I&#8217;m going to start reading about clojure and taking notes
(and maybe even posting them!). I&#8217;ve never been very good about taking
notes, ever in my life. But, I clearly <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/03/how-to-brain-dump-what-you-know/">need to learn</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://inotify.aiken.cz/">incron</a> seems to be a pretty neat tool. It&#8217;s
cron-for-file-activities. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a> is a
common unix tool that allows you to run any command at a specified
time. It&#8217;s immensely useful for running anything that you want to occur on
a regular basis: backups, daily reminder emails, downloading podcasts,
etc. If you&#8217;ve used unix to any significant extent, you&#8217;ve used cron.</p>

<p>incron takes that cron metaphor and applies it to file activity. You
specify which files you want to watch, and then you specify which activities
you are interested in. If incron notices any of those activities occurring
on your files, it launches the command that you specified. Activities could
include creating a new file, modifying a file, accessing a file, among
multiple other possibilities. incron takes advantage of the inotify system
built into recent linux kernels, which supposedly is more efficient than
previous ways of doing this same thing.</p>

<p>incron seemed to be just what I wanted. I wanted to watch a specific
directory and launch a tool to rebuild my website if any of those files
changed. The problem is that incron doesn&#8217;t work recursively on
directories. You have to specify each directory, the activities on that
directory, and the command to launch. If you create new directories, you
have to tell incron about them specifically. This ruins the benefit of the
tool for me. It seems the developer has been planning to implement
recursive watching for the past 4 years ago, but hasn&#8217;t done it yet. If it
hasn&#8217;t happened in 4 years, it&#8217;s probably not going to happen soon.</p>

<p>But, I found a perfectly usable way to get what I
want. <a href="http://wiki.github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/">inotify-tools</a>
includes a program called <code>inotifywait</code>. It takes a file or directory name
and listens for specific activities that you are interested in. It
basically waits until it sees one of those activities and then returns
control back to you. So, you can something like (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>while (inotifywait /home/vinod/web/kurup.org):
    # triggered
    rebuild my server
</code></pre>

<p><code>inotifywait</code> waits for my activities. If it finds one, it returns TRUE and
my server gets rebuilt, and then the while loop restarts. Best of all,
<code>inotifywait</code> can work recursively on a directory. Which brings me to my
<code>watch-rebuild.sh</code> script which watches my web source files for changes,
and rebuilds the web generated files on demand. It also pops up a little
GNOME notification using <code>notify-send</code>:</p>

<p>$$code(lang=bash)</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

BLOGOFILE='/usr/local/bin/blogofile'
BLOGDIR='/home/vinod/web/kurup.org'

# requires libnotify-bin for notify-osd notification
# requires inotify-tools
while LINE=$(inotifywait -rq --timefmt '%F %R' --format '%T %e %f' \
      -e close_write -e move -e delete "$BLOGDIR");
do
        echo -n "Rebuilding $LINE ..."
        $BLOGOFILE -s $BLOGDIR build
        echo "done"
        notify-send -u low "Rebuild Done" "Watching again"
done
</code></pre>

<p>$$/code</p>

<p><code>-r</code> = recursive<br/>
<code>-q</code> = be quiet<br/>
<code>--timefmt</code> &amp; <code>--format</code> = what we want to display on the command line<br/>
<code>-e</code> = each of the individual events that we are interested in</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Kavi&#8217;s bedroom - 8PM</h4>

<p>DADDY and KAVI are lying next to each other in KAVI&#8217;s bed doing their
bedtime ritual. They have finished singing a song and are recapping the
day.</p>

<p>DADDY: Did you play with playdoh today?</p>

<p>KAVI: No.</p>

<p>DADDY: Are you sure? Did you play with playdoh this morning before going to
the Puffin room?</p>

<p>(KAVI thinks)</p>

<p>KAVI: Yes. I did. Why did I play with playdoh?</p>

<p>DADDY: Because you wanted to. You asked me if you could play with it.</p>

<p>KAVI: Why did I want to play with the playdoh?</p>

<p>DADDY: I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>KAVI: Why you don&#8217;t know?</p>

<p>DADDY: Because. I can&#8217;t answer that question.</p>

<p>KAVI: Why you can&#8217;t answer that question?</p>

<p>DADDY: It&#8217;s a question of your motivation, KAVI. I can speculate about why
you wanted to play with the playdoh, but I can&#8217;t tell you why you wanted
to.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>KAVI: Why?</p>

<p>DADDY: I can tell you what I want, but I can&#8217;t tell you what you want.</p>

<p>KAVI: What do you want DADDY?</p>

<p>(DADDY takes a deep breath)</p>

<p>DADDY: A lot of things. I want you to grow up to be a strong, intelligent,
loving, happy boy. I want Anika to grow up to be a strong, intelligent,
loving, happy girl. I want Mommy to be able to do what she wants in life. I
want all of us to travel, spend time with family, and enjoy the world. That&#8217;s
what I want.</p>

<p>KAVI: oh.</p>

<p>DADDY: What do you want?</p>

<p>KAVI: Playdoh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is going to be a great year. I was working on New Year&#8217;s Eve. My shift
was supposed to end at midnight, which meant that I would normally be home
around 12:30 AM, but my colleague let me out early since the ER was
unusually light. I got home at 11:55 PM, so I was able to kiss my beautiful
wife as the new year began. If that&#8217;s not an auspicious start to a year, I
don&#8217;t know what one would be.</p>

<p>I am so lucky. I have a great job, which is getting better all the time. I
work hard, but I get some pretty good karmic rewards. It&#8217;s not perfect and
maybe someday I&#8217;ll rant about the pitfalls of being a hospitalist, but it&#8217;s
certainly better than my life was as a primary care doctor.</p>

<p>I live in a beautiful house where I feel comfortable and &#8220;at home&#8221;. I have
a loving extended family who, thankfully, are all pretty happy and healthy.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I have an amazing wife and 2 darling children who can
lift my heart into the heavens just by looking at me a certain way. They
can also make me feel completely unfit to be a father sometimes, but I
guess that&#8217;s part of being a father. I have so much to teach them and they
have so much to teach me.</p>

<p>This is starting to feel like a &#8220;Thanksgiving&#8221; post rather than a &#8220;New
Year&#8217;s&#8221; post. The bottom line is that I have a great feeling that this is
going to be a great year for me and my family.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Mala and I started looking for homes, we listed on a yellow notepad
all the things that were important to us. Like most little notes in my
life, it got lost. I found it a few days after we moved into our home and
was pleasantly surprised that we had gotten everything on our list, except
a lake view. Not bad, and there&#8217;s a lake about a half mile from our
door. One of the things on that list that we &#8220;kinda&#8221; got was &#8220;running
trails nearby&#8221;. I say &#8220;kinda&#8221; because there is a trail which is just behind
the back of our property, but I wouldn&#8217;t call it a running trail. It is a
paved trail which runs behind the houses in our neighborhood and extends
about 1 mile in total length. It is mostly through woods or along the lake,
so it&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s not a running trail. A running trail is not
paved. More importantly, a running trail goes for miles and miles, so that
you can feel like you are away from (sub)urban life.</p>

<p>So this was one of those things on our &#8220;list&#8221; that I would say we checked
off, but, not really, you know?</p>

<p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/vkurup/status/4533018776">went for a run</a> recently
and I can now say with certainty that this is my dream house. That paved
running trail which I had been so ambivalent about eventually ends at a
main road. And that&#8217;s where I thought it ended. On Thursday, I crossed the
road and found a little mowed path which takes you to the local high
school. And then you take a right and WOW! A huge forest with a 10 foot
wide rock and dirt trail opens up in front of you. I started down this
trail, expecting it to end at someone&#8217;s private property, but it kept going
and going and going. It ran next to a bubbling stream with water clear
enough to see the river&#8217;s bottom. There were countless little paths snaking
away from the main one. I just kept running and it just got more and more
beautiful. I wish I had brought my camera. It felt like a religious
experience. I couldn&#8217;t believe that this beautiful, seemingly endless trail
- the type of trail that I would have driven miles to get to in the past -
was in my backyard. I ended up running 11 miles, which is longer than I
have run since moving to North Carolina. I can&#8217;t wait to run there
again. This is just another example of how I am the luckiest man in the
world. I always wanted to live in a house near trails like this, but didn&#8217;t
think it was possible, so I settled for a little &#8220;running trail&#8221;. Just my
luck, it turns out to be the trail of my dreams :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>A friend asked for some investing advice a few years ago. Here was my response.</em></p>

<p>I have a feeling this is going to be long&#8230; :-)</p>

<p>First thing - I don&#8217;t know your exact financial situation, but I know
you&#8217;re in great shape for the long run. Anyone thinking this seriously
about their finances this early in life will do fine. Also, since I don&#8217;t
know much about your exact situation, this may be a little
&#8216;condescending&#8217;. I&#8217;m sure you know I don&#8217;t mean it that way. Just take what
you need from it and leave the rest. Also feel free to ask questions about
anything at any time. I love finances and it would be my pleasure to help
if there&#8217;s any way that I can. I&#8217;ve read A LOT of books and stuff, so it
would be nice to be of use to others.</p>

<p>The <strong>ABSOLUTE</strong> most important thing is to get out of debt. Nothing kills
your financial future more than debt. No matter how good of an investor you
are, you won&#8217;t get anywhere if you don&#8217;t take control of debt. Make that
your main focus. Until you are completely debt-free (except for a
mortgage), I wouldn&#8217;t put too much time into investing. Have you heard of
<a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave Ramsey</a>? He has an excellent talk-radio
show about getting out of debt. It&#8217;s a bit basic sometimes, and like all
talk-radio hosts, he&#8217;s &#8220;over-the-top&#8221;, but he provides really useful
information. The most valuable thing about it is the repetition. Listeners
call in with their financial situation and he takes each one of them
through the same process. He calls them the Baby Steps, and they&#8217;re really
just common sense, but listening to him walk listeners through them <em>over
and over</em> makes it stick in your head. He also advocates developing a
laser-like focus. Don&#8217;t try to do a hundred things at once. Focus on <strong>one
thing</strong> at a time, whether it&#8217;s paying off one credit card, or building up
an emergency fund, or whatever. Once that one thing is done, then move to
the next item. That simplifies life and is a better use of your energy than
trying to fix everything with little bits of your attention here and little
bits over there.</p>

<p>A book that everyone should read is <a

margin:0px !important;" />, which discusses the habits that financially
successful people share. It also focuses on getting out of debt and living
more simply. The advice seems pretty sound even though the methodology of
the book isn&#8217;t. Taking a bunch of millionaires and finding out common
features among them <strong>is not</strong> good science.</p>

<p>All that said, thinking about investing at any time is a useful
endeavor. Just as long as you maintain your focus on getting out of debt.</p>

<p>The only people who should be investing in individual stocks are those who
enjoy it. If you don&#8217;t relish reading financial statements and analyzing
stock valuations, then you shouldn&#8217;t be doing it. Life is too short. Do
stuff you enjoy and make your financial plan as simple as possible. Your
overall return will still be in the top 10-20% of all investors.</p>

<p>The most important part of investing is following a strict plan. And that
plan should be focused on asset allocation. What does that mean? There are
various classes of assets that you can invest in. The most common ones are
stocks, bonds, and real estate. Within each class, there are subclasses,
like small stocks, value stocks, international stocks, etc. It&#8217;s almost
impossible to know which class will do well over the short term, even
though the talking heads on CNBC will tell you they think they
know. Studies show that it&#8217;s a toss up. So, the smartest thing to do is to
look at the long term return of each asset class (past 20-50 years), decide
what percent of your portfolio you want to place in each class, and then
<strong>STICK WITH IT THROUGH THICK AND THIN</strong>. That is capitalized because that
is the most important part. If you constantly adjust your percentages
because you &#8220;think&#8221; large tech stocks are going to start doing well, then
you will kill this approach. Everyone thought tech stocks were going to do
well in 1999. 2000 killed them. My favorite book describing this strategy
and the rationale behind it is <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393330338?ie=UTF8&tag=vinodkurupshomep&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393330338">A
Random Walk Down Wall Street</a><img
src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=vinodkurupshomep&l=as2&o=1&a=0393330338"
width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;
margin:0px !important;" /> by Burton Malkiel.</p>

<p>Once you decide what your asset classes should be and what percentages you
want to invest in each (I can help you with suggestions), then you find a
<strong>LOW COST</strong> index fund (or ETF) that tracks that asset class and buy the
appropriate amount. Then just leave it alone until next year. Look at the
results and if one or more asset classes has gotten out of whack with your
desired percentages, then rebalance. Sell a little of the one which has
gotten too big and buy a little of the one that has gotten too small.</p>

<p>This way, you are automatically selling an asset class AFTER it has risen
and buying an asset class when it has been beaten down. You&#8217;re buying low
and selling high.</p>

<p>For someone who wanted the simplest possible investment plan, I would
recommend putting 75% of their portfolio into a broad stock fund (VFINX or
VTSMX) and 25% into a simple low-cost bond fund (VBMFX). Then just
rebalance every year. But you can also make this more complex by splitting
the stock portion into domestic and international, then small and large
companies, etc. It can be as complex as you want; just be sure to keep it
consistent from year to year. That is the key which will allow you to buy
assets when they are at their low point and sell them when they are high.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to invest in individual stocks, I&#8217;d recommend keeping it
to a small portion of your overall portfolio (&lt; 10%). Figuring out how to
value stocks is an art that takes a lifetime. The one book that I&#8217;d
recommend is <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060555661?ie=UTF8&tag=vinodkurupshomep&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060555661">The

width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;
margin:0px !important;" />, by Benjamin Graham. It was written decades ago,
but it gives the groundwork necessary to understand how to invest in
stocks.</p>

<p>In order to really successfully invest in individual stocks, you need to be
able to identify companies that have a sustainable competitive
advantage. This is something that I have a lot of trouble with and haven&#8217;t
really pursued enough. This is what Warren Buffett does. If you really want
to understand this process, read everything on <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html">this
page</a>.</p>

<p>This email is getting a bit long. So let me know if what I scribbled is
understandable and if you have any questions. There&#8217;s more trivia locked up
in this brain of mine, if you want more :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love watching Kavi&#8217;s expressions. We took the kids to the <a href="http://www.ncmls.org/">Museum of Life
and Science</a> for a birthday party today. He&#8217;s been
there plenty of times, mostly with Mala. I&#8217;ve been there a few times with
him. It&#8217;s one of his (and I guess every kid&#8217;s) favorite places. Each time
we go, it&#8217;s a vastly different experience. Everything seems new to him. His
eyes light up with wonder and amazement at the exhibits.</p>

<p>We were late for the party, so Mala took Anika ahead of us while Kavi
dawdled in the front exhibits. Ahead of us was a large skeleton of a
dinosaur&#8217;s head. I know that he has seen this before, but, it was as if
he&#8217;d noticed it for the first time today. And it was scary. Not too scary,
mind you. He wasn&#8217;t crying or anything. He just was very cautious about
getting too close to it. But, there was no way to avoid it, since the party
room (with the cake!) was just past the dinosaur. He held my hand tightly
and asked what it was. I told him and he repeated it, &#8220;Dinosaur?&#8221;. His eyes
were wide open, but focused on the T-Rex&#8217;s head. His right hand clenched my
left and when I tried to walk past it, he pulled me back. Still no crying
or complaining, just &#8230; concern. So I took my time and talked to him about
the dinosaur and the other exhibits nearby. Eventually, he mustered up the
courage to walk around the back of the dinosaur and towards the party
room. Later, after the cake and festivities, we made our way back to the
other exhibits. This time, he pointed out the dinosaur, still in a
concerned voice, but made no effort to shy away or slow down. Now, he
noticed other things that he had missed before &#8211; cool astronauts uniforms
and a glass elevator slowly ascending. When he saw each of these things,
his face turned into the embodiment of wonder. Eyes wide open, jaw slightly
ajar. I love seeing him experience life like this, so fully.</p>

<p>I write this because I know that I&#8217;m otherwise going to forget them. I had
the distinct feeling this afternoon, while watching him, that he was
growing up in front of my eyes. That these expressions of wonderment would
soon be replaced by the apathy of young adulthood. I know, I know&#8230; he&#8217;s
only 2, but everyone keeps telling me that he will be grown and with kids
of his own before I know it! I hope not and if so, I hope not <em>too soon</em>. I
want to make sure that I remember these moments, simply for their own sake.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a runner for a long time. I started running in junior high
school, so I could be on the track team. I&#8217;ve had a few long stretches
where I didn&#8217;t run, but for most of the past 25 years, I&#8217;ve been a runner.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the 2005 New York Marathon though, that I really felt like
a runner. I had already run 2 marathons, but I had walked a lot in both of
them. I ran the entire NYC Marathon from beginning to end. That, to me, was
a <strong>huge</strong> deal. Before 2004, I don&#8217;t think I would ever have believed that
I could do that. I don&#8217;t necessarily think that using walk breaks makes you
any less of a runner. But, <strong>for me</strong>, using walk breaks was a crutch. I&#8217;d
gotten to the point that running 3, 4 or even 5 miles was easy. I dreaded
anything longer than that. If I was planning a 9 mile run, I would start
doing math in my head around mile 3. &#8220;OK, I&#8217;ve done 3 miles, now I just
need to do that again&#8230; and then again&#8230;&#8221; And that&#8217;s where I would defeat
myself. I mean, I was already tired at mile 3! How was I going to do that
same distance <em>twice</em> more?</p>

<p>Sometime around 2004, that changed. I was working at Metropolitan Hospital,
which is on 96th street and 1st avenue in NYC. I had decided to run the NYC
Marathon in 2005, but I wasn&#8217;t training enough. After the subway ride home
from work, I would be drained, and going out for a run at 6 or 7 PM was
just too much to even think about. I&#8217;m so glad that I had made the decision
to run the marathon. I hadn&#8217;t even signed up - it was way too early - but
that decision in my brain was firm. I knew that I had to find a way to
train. Running in the morning was an option, but if you know me, then you
know that it wasn&#8217;t. :-) Ironically, I&#8217;m now up before 5AM every day these
days because of my 2 precious little ones. But, back in those bachelor
days, mornings didn&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>I decided to make running part of my daily commute. I would take the subway
to work and then run home after work. I was living on 22nd St and 3rd
Avenue, so it was a 5 mile run along the East River. Living in NYC was so
convenient in that way. I never had to worry about leaving a car at work or
figuring out what to do if I couldn&#8217;t run all the way home. The subway was
always there. I started out by running every couple days, then every other
day, and then, as many days as I could. It was great for training and for
my peace of mind. There&#8217;s no better way to release the stress of a workday
than a long, easy run. I got much faster during the summer of 2004, and in
September, I ran the Staten Island Half Marathon in 1:41:56, which is much
faster than I ever dreamed was possible at that time.</p>

<p>But getting <em>faster</em> is not the point of this article. Running <em>longer</em> is.</p>

<p>The other thing that happened that summer was that I met and fell in love
with Mala. By the next spring, we had decided to move in together, and we
were both living in her tiny little apartment in the Bronx. At first, this
curbed my running a bit. But, eventually, I came to the same conclusions
that I had made the year before. I <strong>had</strong> to run and the only feasible way
was after work. But, the commute was now 8 miles instead of 5. And instead
of a leisurely jog along the East River, I now had a somewhat exhausting
urban trek through some shady neighborhoods. I never had any real problems,
but I always felt a little fear during parts of my run. Every once in a
while a teenager would see me running and shout something at me, or run
along with me for a few steps. But, it always seemed playful, so I never
felt too threatened. Running with a backpack through the South Bronx
probably made me the craziest thing in the neighborhood, so I didn&#8217;t need
to worry :-) Anyway, the point is that my run was now longer and subway
stops were fewer and further between. In addition, I had all that fear, so
I felt that I needed to conserve energy in case, you know&#8230; I needed to
<strong>sprint!</strong></p>

<p>So, I ended up running a lot <strong>slower</strong>. Even though I was pretty sure I
could make it 8 miles, I started a lot slower and didn&#8217;t start speeding up
until I was within a mile or two of home. And I don&#8217;t mean just a little
slower. I would run so slow that I felt people were thinking, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t
he just walk?&#8221;. That was tough for me. As much as I hate to admit it, I do
think about what other people think, and the last thing I want anyone to
think is that I&#8217;m a slow runner. But, I purposefully shed those superficial
inhibitions in the name of survival. I would slow WAY down. This eventually
served two purposes. The most important immediate purpose was that it
allowed to me to get home safely each night. The more lasting purpose was
that it gave me the confidence that I can always <em>build up energy</em> by
slowing down. No matter how tired I was, if I slowed down enough, I would
build up energy again. I know it makes sense, but I didn&#8217;t believe it until
I tried it. And I guess I thought I <em>had</em> tried it before, but the problem
was my ego. I had never let myself really slow enough to the point that it
was valuable. Slowing down was the best thing I ever did as a runner.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s how I was able to run the NYC marathon without stopping in
2005. Now, even when I haven&#8217;t been training regularly, I know that I can
run 10+ miles on any given day. Just by slowing down. They won&#8217;t be the
fastest 10 miles I&#8217;ve run, but it&#8217;s such a great feeling to know that I can
do it. It gives me freedom in my runs, too. I know I can take any hill,
just by slowing down. I can speed up at any point in my run, just by
slowing down before and afterwards.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;ve gotten to the point that you can run 3 miles comfortably, but
couldn&#8217;t dream of running 10 or 20, slow way down. So slow that you feel
like a fraud. See if that doesn&#8217;t let you run longer. And if that fails,
try running in the Bronx :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m too weak to lug around my monstrous 7 pound laptop, so I bought a
<a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/product1000.html">netbook</a>. It&#8217;s an eeepc
1000 and I love it. I use it for everything, except for processing the
kids&#8217; videos and photos. I still use the desktop for that.</p>

<p>The major issue that I&#8217;ve had with it is that firefox seemed so slow. I
tried other browsers, some which seemed faster, but I missed my firefox
extensions. I googled and found that <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC/TipsAndTricks#SpeedupsluggishIceweasel.2BAC8-Firefox3">others had the same
issue</a>. There
are 2 flash hard drives in the eeepc. The first is 8GB and contains the
root filesystem. The second is 32GB and contains the <code>/home</code>
partition. Apparently the 8GB drive is <strong>significantly</strong> faster than the
32GB one. So the OS performs excellently since it&#8217;s on the 8GB drive,
anything that requires a lot of disk access from the 32GB drive slows
down. Firefox&#8217;s <code>.mozilla</code> configuration folder is mounted there by
default.</p>

<p>Moving the <code>.mozilla</code> folder to the 8GB drive has made web browsing speedy
again. Here&#8217;s how I did it. I&#8217;m the only user on my system, so if you have
multiple users, this will only fix the issue for one user.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla
sudo chown vinod /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla
mv /home/vinod/.mozilla /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla/
ln -s /usr/local/share/vinod-mozilla/.mozilla /home/vinod/.mozilla
