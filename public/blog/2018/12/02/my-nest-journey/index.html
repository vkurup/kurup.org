     My Nest Journey

        <div class="entry-content">
          
          
          
          <p>I got 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/2zE10T1">Nest E thermostats</a> because Duke Energy was having a sale around
Black Friday. I didn&rsquo;t have any strong motivation to have a Nest. The idea of a smart home is cool,
but most &lsquo;smart&rsquo; things nowadays have ended up being more work than benefit. Anyway, for $75 each, I
thought it was worth a try. We have 2 thermostats so I decided to install the upstairs thermostat
first. The process started off smooth and easy. I like that they provide a back plate, which I
didn&rsquo;t even notice until my trusty assistant, Kavi, pointed it out. My existing Honeywell thermostat
is rectangular and if I just put the small circular Nest in its place, there would be a big chunk of
unpainted real estate on the wall. Having the back plate prevented this from being a &lsquo;replace
thermostat, and learn how to patch and paint the wall&rsquo; project. The online
<a href="https://nest.com/support/article/How-to-tell-if-your-heating-and-cooling-system-will-work-with-the-Nest-Thermostat#works/?mode=guide">Nest compatibility checker</a>
and the paper instruction manual (which includes stickers to label the existing wires) are also nice
touches. That all gave me the (misguided?) confidence that even I could do this. A study confidence
which lasted until I flipped the circuit breaker back on and &hellip;. nothing happened. According to the
manual, the Nest was supposed to turn on, say Hi, and then walk me through the set up process. But
it remained dead as a doorknob. I pulled it off the wall and plugged it in via USB (a nice
troubleshooting feauture). It turned on and then when I placed it back on the wall, it complained
that it was not getting enough power from the R wire. The error code was E195. When I looked at the
&lsquo;Technical Info&rsquo;, it reported that the R wire was only providing 2-3 volts, while it needed 24. I
chatted up Nest support, which took about 30 minutes to connect on a Friday night. The
representative was responsive and useful. They eventually recommended trying to disconnect the C
(common) wire. For a reason I still can&rsquo;t explain, this brought the voltage on the R wire from 2-3
volts up to 35 volts, and my Nest was working.</p>

<p>Having tasted the sweet nectar of success, I then tried to swap my second Nest in for my downstairs
thermostat. I made a huge mistake here. It had been easy to identify the circuit breaker for my
upstairs furnance because it was labelled, &ldquo;Up Furnace&rdquo;. But there was nothing labelling the
downstairs furnace. I switched off the circuit breaker that I thought was responsible for the
downstairs HVAC, but in hindsight, I think I got the wrong one (and since it was warm out and the
heater wasn&rsquo;t running, I didn&rsquo;t notice because nothing was running in the first place). Anyway, I
walked through the rest of the instructions and again got to the point where the Nest was supposed
to power on, but it didn&rsquo;t. So I powered it on via USB and placed it back on the wall.
Unfortunately, this time I was getting only 0.01 volts from the R line. Still, I was hoping that the
&lsquo;disconnect the C wire&rsquo; trick would work again. Unfortunately, disconnecting the C wire did nothing.
I walked through things with Customer Service chat. Again, they were helpful (rather than just
spouting cookbook-type basic info), but in the end, they didn&rsquo;t have a recommendation that would fix
things. They suggested that I get a voltmeter and test the voltage output at the various wires. I do
not have a voltmeter and felt that I was getting in over my head, so instead I put in some calls to
HVAC service companies, but since it was the weekend and this wasn&rsquo;t urgent, I was resigned to
having no heat over the weekend. I watched a few Youtube videos of HVAC repairs, some of which were
quite entertaining. Eventually, I tried to reconnect my old Honeywell thermostat and was surprised
and intrigued when this ALSO failed. It made me think that I messed something up somehow. The only
thing I could think of was that since I hit the wrong circuit breaker, there was live current in the
wires. While moving them from the Honeywell to the Nest, perhaps I touched 2 wires together causing
the system to short circuit. I don&rsquo;t remember noticing a spark or anything, but that was my best
guess. I eventually watched enough videos to give myself confidence that I could open up the HVAC
and find the electrical panel. I did that successfully (after turning off the CORRECT circuit
breaker, and also pulling out the pull out switch next to the furnace). After cleaning out a ton of
cobwebs, I found the LED light on the electrical panel was off (even after connecting the circuits
temporarily). I searched the panel and found a 3-amp E fuse (like the kind I&rsquo;ve seen in automobile
fuseboxes). I pulled it out and sure enough, it was blown. It looked like the &lsquo;bad fuse&rsquo; in this
<a href="https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/how-to-check-fuses-by-rocco-lovetere">photo</a>. Off to Home
Depot, I purchased 2 replacements for 3 dollars, and then replaced the busted fuse with the new one.
I flipped the circuit breaker and put the pull-in switch back in. The first encouraging sign was
that the red LED light on the electrical panel turned on. I went inside and, joy of joys, the Nest
was booting up and showed 35V via the R wire. So, I guess the bottom line is that I need to be more
careful when I&rsquo;m at the circuit breaker box.</p>
