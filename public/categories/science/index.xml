      <description>Like the rest of the geek world, we&amp;rsquo;ve been excited by Curiosity&amp;rsquo;s successful trip to Mars. Here&amp;rsquo;s a cool video which combines an animation of Curiosity&amp;rsquo;s landing mixed with the real reactions of the astronauts that got it there. (Found on thekidshouldseethis.com)
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been disappointed that real space travel is unlikely to become a reality during my life. I honestly thought it would when I was a kid. But watching Curiosity gives me hope that we will be able to continue exploring our universe.</description>
