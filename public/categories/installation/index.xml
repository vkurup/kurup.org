      <description>Thanks to the fine folks at badgertronics, I was able to upgrade my Powerbook to Panther free-of-charge. I initially did an &amp;ldquo;Archive and Install&amp;rdquo; upgrade, as recommended by the upgrade guide at TidBITS (easily worth the measly $5, IMHO). But soon after the install, I noticed that my system seemed a lot slower. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint a specific problem, but things just seemed sluggish. I definitely noticed that DNS seemed to be broken.</description>
