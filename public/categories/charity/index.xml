      <description>I posted about this last year, so here&amp;rsquo;s our updated donation list for 2006. Again, I think they&amp;rsquo;re all great causes, so I encourage you to check them out.
 Electronic Frontier Foundation - The internet is the most innovative force in our lives and the EFF working to preserve freedom on the net. Free Software Foundation - When software is free, it means that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel over and over again.</description>
