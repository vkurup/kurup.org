      <description>The power finally came back on at around 7:20 PM tonight. I was sitting on my futon trying as hard as I could not to sweat, when I heard a loud cheer from the courtyard and saw that the lights had gone on in the apartments outside my window.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a weird couple of days. The power went out around 4:15 PM yesterday while I was looking up some labs in the preceptor&amp;rsquo;s room.</description>
