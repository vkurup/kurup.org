      <description>I did something yesterday that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before. I took a ride on the subway from one end all the way to the other end. I took the D train from 205th street in the Bronx to Coney Island/Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn, passing through Manhattan on the way. Left at 6:04 AM and arrived at 7:46 AM, just in time to make it to the start of the Brooklyn Half Marathon.</description>

      <description>It was cold out there today. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, a headband and gloves, and I was still cold. I doubted whether I&amp;rsquo;d be able to break 2 hours, like I&amp;rsquo;d hoped. A mile into the race I was sure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to do it. It felt like I was just running in place. As usual though, I eventually warmed up and felt pretty good.</description>
