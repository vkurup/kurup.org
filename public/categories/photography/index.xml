      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something about photography that seems to attract programmers. So many of the really good programmers that I know are also into photography. I, on the other hand, am just happy if my latest photo of the kids doesn&amp;rsquo;t include massive red eye. I&amp;rsquo;m always happy when a shot looks nice, but I know I&amp;rsquo;m not interested enough to be an exceptional photographer. I&amp;rsquo;ve never wanted a fancy SLR camera because I know I&amp;rsquo;d leave it on the shelf collecting dust.</description>
