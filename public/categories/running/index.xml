      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m a runner and have been for almost 30 years now. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m only going to get slower from here on in, so I thought I should list all my PR&amp;rsquo;s so that I can brag while I can.
Here are my blog posts about running.
PRs  | Age &amp;lt;= 30 | Age &amp;gt; 30 | -----------+-----------+----------+ 800m | 2:12 | N/A | 1 mile | 5:07 | 5:44 | 2 mile | 11:06 | N/A | 5K | 18:36 | 23:02 | 13.</description>

      <description>When we made our 2018 goals last year, Kavi, Anika and I all had some running-related goals. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember offhand exactly what each of our goals were, but I think we all wanted to run more races, because well, races are fun! I somehow stumbled on the Triangle Race Series. It&amp;rsquo;s a series of a couple dozen races throughout the year around the Triangle, so we signed up for a few.</description>

      <title>Getting through the start of a run</title>

      <description>I love running. Wait, that&amp;rsquo;s a lie. I love running after I&amp;rsquo;ve finished my run. I also love it during those periods where I get my runner&amp;rsquo;s high, usually around the 30 minute mark, but often it happens multiple times after that point. I don&amp;rsquo;t love running when I&amp;rsquo;m contemplating going for a run. There are rare occasions where I&amp;rsquo;m just itching to go for a run, but usually I&amp;rsquo;m only able start a run by forcibly suppressing the compelling rationalizations that my brain develops.</description>

      <title>Running as a metaphor for life</title>

      <description>I was thinking the other day, on a run, of course, about the many ways that running is a metaphor for life. I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed some of this before with my cousins Dilu and Harish before.
 &amp;hellip; two roads diverged in a wood, and I &amp;ndash;
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
 While trail running, I have come to the realization that you never have to worry about the fork in the road, nor the decision associated with it.</description>

      <description>I ran the 15K Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Way Trail Run today. It&amp;rsquo;s on the eastern end of Carolina North Forest. I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a lot on the western end of these trails so I had never seen any of these trails before. The weather was perfect - sunny and mid 50&amp;rsquo;s - and the trails were in good shape. I only got a little muddy. The race was very well organized for such a small race.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Mala&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a lot more over the past month. Whenever I get into a good running rhythm, my mind starts to relax and I occasionally get bright ideas (believe it or not!). While I am running, these always seem Nobel Prize-worthy, but they seem to lose some of their glitter when the endorphins wear off. I still believe we could solve all the world&amp;rsquo;s problems if everyone was a runner.</description>

      <description>When Mala and I started looking for homes, we listed on a yellow notepad all the things that were important to us. Like most little notes in my life, it got lost. I found it a few days after we moved into our home and was pleasantly surprised that we had gotten everything on our list, except a lake view. Not bad, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lake about a half mile from our door.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a runner for a long time. I started running in junior high school, so I could be on the track team. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few long stretches where I didn&amp;rsquo;t run, but for most of the past 25 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a runner.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the 2005 New York Marathon though, that I really felt like a runner. I had already run 2 marathons, but I had walked a lot in both of them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to thank Deepu for giving me a list of some cool podcasts to check out. My commute is about 30 minutes each way, and listening to podcasts I enjoy helps keep me sane. I added the Moth Podcast, NPR Selected Shorts, and RadioLab to my podcast list and have been enjoying all of them. NPR Shorts is my favorite of the bunch. It&amp;rsquo;s usually 2 short stories being read live somewhere in NYC.</description>

      <description>I did something yesterday that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before. I took a ride on the subway from one end all the way to the other end. I took the D train from 205th street in the Bronx to Coney Island/Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn, passing through Manhattan on the way. Left at 6:04 AM and arrived at 7:46 AM, just in time to make it to the start of the Brooklyn Half Marathon.</description>

      <description>Stop what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and go buy the July 2006 issue of Runner&amp;rsquo;s World. Flip to page 49 and read the fine article by Scott Douglas on things a runner should discuss with their physician.
Yep, the &amp;ldquo;Vinod Kurup&amp;rdquo; quoted is yours truly! I&amp;rsquo;m really grateful to Scott for using me as a source and thus making my dream of being in Runner&amp;rsquo;s World come true. :)
Here&amp;rsquo;s the online version of the article, but go check out the magazine because it&amp;rsquo;s, you know, much cooler.</description>

      <description>I built a web application to keep track of my running a couple years ago. I really began using it in earnest during my training for the New York Marathon last year. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to make it available for others to use for a long time, but it always seemed like there was a little more work I needed to do on it. While working on it the other day, I noticed the original timestamp on one of the source files: September 21, 2003 Yikes!</description>

      <description>It was cold out there today. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, a headband and gloves, and I was still cold. I doubted whether I&amp;rsquo;d be able to break 2 hours, like I&amp;rsquo;d hoped. A mile into the race I was sure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to do it. It felt like I was just running in place. As usual though, I eventually warmed up and felt pretty good.</description>

      <description>I ran the NYRR Hot Chocolate 15K (9.3 miles) this morning. It was cold, but then again, it&amp;rsquo;s the middle of December, so whaddya expect? I&amp;rsquo;ve only run twice since the marathon, so I took it nice and easy. I planned to run about 10 minute miles, but I felt good around mile 5, so I sped up. I finished in 1:25:22 (9:10 per mile).
Oh yeah&amp;hellip; and the Hot Chocolate was awesome!</description>

      <description>The marathon is tomorrow. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty nervous. I really want to break 5 hours this time. You can track me online at the NY Marathon site. I&amp;rsquo;ll be runner number 27072.
UPDATE 2005-11-14:
I finished in 4:28:09 (chip time). I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with my time and the whole experience. Running down 4th avenue in Brooklyn was crowded, but just breathtaking. You could see a river of people for what seemed like miles ahead.</description>

      <description>I ran the Bronx Half-Marathon on Sunday in 2:07:05. I ran the same race last year in 2:07:02. How&amp;rsquo;s that for consistent?. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be consistently fast than consistently slow, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to look on the bright side. By the way, I really do enjoy these races more than my pictures would suggest :-)
We started near Lehman College and ran along beautiful tree-lined streets like Sedgwick Avenue and Mosholu Parkway.</description>

      <description>I admit it. As a runner, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessive about my mileage. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m obsessive about running and getting my mileage in. That would be a good thing. Once I do go for a run, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessive about knowing exactly how far I&amp;rsquo;ve run.
In high school, I&amp;rsquo;d finish my run and then promptly jump on my 10-speed bike which had an odometer, so I could measure how far I&amp;rsquo;d gone.</description>

      <description>Fred Lebow Classic
I&amp;rsquo;ve run about 10 miles in the past 2 months, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting anything great on Sunday. My conservative goal was 50 minutes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t set any other goals.
I got to the start a little late and didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to find the baggage area, so I strapped on my backpack and ran with it. This made it feel even more like a training run, rather than a race.</description>

      <description>I ran the Fitness Magazine 4 mile race in Central Park last weekend. The remnants of Hurricane Ivan were flooding the streets, so I was certain that the race would be cancelled (or that I would chicken out). Neither happened as the sky cleared 10 minutes before the race started.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t warm up as much as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked, but the first 2 miles went suprisingly well (7:11, 7:16). The hills on mile 3 killed me (7:51), but I was able to pick it up at the end (7:29).</description>

      <description>I ran 5 more races this summer in my quest to automatically qualify for next year&amp;rsquo;s New York Marathon. The Fifth Avenue Mile was a breakthrough run for me. I easily outdid my pre-race goal of breaking 7 minutes and came within 40 seconds of my best time ever (5:07 fifteen years ago). This makes me think that I might be able to break 4 hours in the marathon next year if I train properly.</description>

      <description>I ran the Queens Half-Marathon on Saturday in 2:11:25. That&amp;rsquo;s about 10 minute miles for 13.1 hot humid miles. It was especially fun because my parents were here visiting from Wisconsin and I think this is the first time they saw me run. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how much of a boost that gave me.</description>

      <description>Researchers at my alma mater have shown that mice who have been bred to run long distances show increased activity in &amp;lsquo;craving&amp;rsquo; regions of the brain when they&amp;rsquo;re denied access to their running wheel (Be sure to check out the Quicktime video on that page). The addiction of running is physiologically similar to other addictions. Maybe that explains why I was out on the East River Path in 29 degree weather tonight.</description>

      <description>I ran two more races this past week - the Race to Deliver 4 mile in Central Park on Sunday and the Turkey Trot 5 mile in Prospect Park yesterday. The Race to Deliver was crowded with 6000 or so other runners and I spent most of the first half of the race just swerving around everyone else. I never quite got into a groove, but I was still able to finish in 32:34.</description>

      <description>I ran the NYRR Cross Country Championships this AM in 26:48 for 5K. My last cross country race was 15 years ago as a senior in high school. Wow, writing that sentence makes me feel old :-) In those days, I could run 5K in 19 minutes easily and I thought that 7 minute miles were slow. Ahh, to be young again! The NYRR run is held at Van Cortland Park, a beautiful oasis in the Bronx and the race starts out deceptively flat.</description>

      <description>I ran the Marine Corps Marathon yesterday and can now confirm that Hitting the Wall is a real phenomenon. I finished about 5 minutes faster than I did in Chicago (2000), but I was really hoping to break 4:30. Everything was going great through the halfway point (2:11:48 - 10:04 mpm) when a few doubts started to creep into my head. I&amp;rsquo;m only halfway? I gotta do this again? Somehow I was able to make it through to mile 17 at 2:55:30 (10:19 mpm) before things really fell apart.</description>

      <description>Dilu and Amit raced 26.2 miles in the Chicago Marathon today and both finished with amazing times. Dilu completed his first marathon in 4:19:18 which is less than 10 minute miles and almost an hour better than my first one. Amit ran the 2000 Chicago Marathon with me and finished in 4:30ish, I think. He ran today in 3:57:32 - breaking that elusive 4 hr barrier. Nice job guys!
Now I&amp;rsquo;m excited for the Marine Corps Marathon - 2 weeks to go.</description>

      <description>I can barely believe it myself, but I ran 20 miles this morning in Central Park. The New York Road Runners Club organized a long run for people training for fall marathons. The longest I had run before was about 17 miles for my Chicago Marathon training, but I remember that &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; being mostly walking in the second half.
Today went much better. I started with the 10:30 pace group and stayed with them.</description>

      <title>Getting faster...</title>

      <description>I got home as it was getting dark, so I ran at the gym, on the treadmill. I usually hate running indoors, but running on the treadmill has one huge positive point. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay attention where you&amp;rsquo;re going. I got myself into a groove and before I knew it, I was done with my 5 miles in about 47 minutes. Much faster than I was just a few months ago!</description>

      <title>Running in the Rain</title>

      <description>It was pouring, monsoon-style here in NYC today, but I went running anyway. When it&amp;rsquo;s raining, no one else is out, so I get the path to myself. And jumping over (or through) the puddles makes me feel like a tough guy. I swear I can hear the Rocky theme song when I run in the rain. The only bad thing about running in the rain is that the always-stunning midtown skyline gets obscured by the clouds.</description>

      <description>Ugh&amp;hellip; I woke up this morning with a nagging pain in my right knee. It kinda improved through the day, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too worried about it, but when I tried to run on it this evening, it really hurt. So I&amp;rsquo;m gonna keep to the bike for awhile. I remember having this problem (which I think is patellar tendonitis) during the last marathon and I remember that it got better pretty quick, so I&amp;rsquo;m praying it&amp;rsquo;s the same this time.</description>

      <description>My cousin Deepu and I (plus about 30,000 or so other people) ran the Chicago Marathon. Cross that off my life&amp;rsquo;s to-do list!</description>
