      <description>So, I just talked with one of my best friends and learned that he still doesn&amp;rsquo;t read my blog. Devastating! We had an interesting conversation about how the value of &amp;lsquo;The Great Idea&amp;rsquo; can be overrated and I wanted to point him to this great essay about the same topic by Paul Graham. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how long it takes him to find it.
I enjoy most of Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s writings. He writes about startups and software, aimed at the high school/college age geek.</description>

      <description>An opportunity arose that I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up. I&amp;rsquo;ve been offered a position with an internet startup company. The company is medicalrecords.com and is focused on providing a place for patients to store their own medical records.</description>
