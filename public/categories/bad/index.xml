      <description>I had the commute from hell this morning. The 4 train went &amp;ldquo;Out of service&amp;rdquo; at 149th street, so we all got off and crowded onto the other nearly-full 4 train going downtown. They closed the doors for a minute, then opened the doors and said &amp;lsquo;This 4 is out of service&amp;rsquo;. So now there are 2 train-fulls of people trying to get to the 5 train downstairs. It was chaos.</description>
