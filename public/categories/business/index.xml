      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I keep reading books about entrepreneurship. I like the idea of building a business, having passion for something, and most importantly, living life on your own terms. I just don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m cut out for it. But see if that will stop me from devouring Hacker News, startup podcasts and books like Derek Sivers&amp;rsquo; Anything You Want.
Derek was a musician who started selling his own CDs online in the days before Paypal.</description>

      <description>I read this book in 2005, but never posted this review. So here it is&amp;hellip;
Growing a Business by Paul Hawken This is an honest and practical guide to running a business. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember where I first heard about this book. Maybe Lars?
It was written in 1987. Hawken talks about building a business. It&amp;rsquo;s often portrayed as a heroic or glamorous endeavor, but really it&amp;rsquo;s not. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of hard work, but also a lot of common sense.</description>
