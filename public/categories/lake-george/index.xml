      <description>Cousins Trip 2005 (photos) was in Lake George, NY this year. The weather didn&amp;rsquo;t quite cooperate this time. It was cloudy and rainy all week. Still, we were able to get in a great hike, some competitive bowling, basketball and mini-golf, not to mention enjoying the 2nd annual Elvis Festival. While we didn&amp;rsquo;t run into any bears, we did see plenty of wildlife. Of course, I would be a rumpcake if I were to forget to mention our late-night Taboo contests, the highlight of the trip.</description>
