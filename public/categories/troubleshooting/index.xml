      <description>No one but me noticed, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, but my website was down for part of yesterday. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, refunds to paying customers are on their way :-)
What happened? I was doing my regular debian apt-get upgrade and the reverse proxy that I use, pound, got updated. The upgrade was a pretty significant one. Pound 2.0 changed the way that it expects configuration files to be formatted. Unfortunately, the Debian update didn&amp;rsquo;t mention this, so the new version of pound tried to read my old config file, got confused and shut down.</description>
