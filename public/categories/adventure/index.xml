      <description>If you go on adventure trips, you should read &amp;ldquo;Deep Survival&amp;rdquo;, by Laurence Gonzales. I finished it on my marathon subway rides yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s partly a voyeuristic look into how people do or don&amp;rsquo;t survive when bad things happen. This part is pure storytelling and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a good story? At times, the outdoorsy jargon made it hard for me to follow what exactly was going on, but on the whole I was sucked in, turning pages to see what happened to our poor characters.</description>
