      <description>Clocky, an alarm clock that runs and hides, so you can&amp;rsquo;t hit snooze.
Comments from old site Just a suggestion
 Why don&#39;t you try putting your alarm clock on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. Instead of something that looks like a cat coughed it up. Andy Drout 2005-04-04 21:25:49</description>

 Please don&#39;t hesitate to delete this post if you believe it is inappropriate.  In late 2007 we are launching a website where people like yourself can upload their Christmas decorated houses.</description>
