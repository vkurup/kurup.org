      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting weird emails over the past day or so. The From: address is always different, there is no body text and there is an attachment called your_document.pif. The From: address is sometimes recognizable, but seems to be spoofed.
Google only gave me 1 document for &amp;ldquo;your_document.pif&amp;rdquo; and that document states that this is a new virus called W32/Sobig.F-mm (link changed due to 404). Not much info about it yet, but it seems pretty widespread.</description>
