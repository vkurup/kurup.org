      <description>I had dinner with a friend of mine whom I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in a few months. Turned out that she had been mugged in the lobby of her apartment in Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen, so she&amp;rsquo;s spent the last few months moving to a safer neighborhood and dealing with all the pain that goes along with that. How sobering. Thanks to self-defense classes that she took in college, she was able to ultimately fight off her attacker by pushing him away just long enough for her to scream for help.</description>
