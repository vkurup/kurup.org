      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned Darwinports before. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to (minimally) documenting my Darwinports OpenACS installation. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite 1-click installation, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting closer.</description>

      <description>In the process of installing Panther from scratch, I decided to use DarwinPorts. It&amp;rsquo;s a packaging system for the abundant UNIX free software available on Mac OS X. I had previously used Fink which, while being an admirable project, seemed a little opaque to me. I never quite knew where data was being installed and which locations were being searched to see if prerequisites were present. Darwinports seems to be a little better at finding programs/libraries that are already installed.</description>
