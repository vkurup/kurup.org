      <description>I take it back. I was upset, OK? Never tweet when you&amp;rsquo;re upset. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post to make up for it. See, a whole blog post. That definitely outweighs a tweet, right?
Last week, my 1996 Altima died. The starter seemed to be firing, but the engine never turned over. We tried jumping it, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I called a tow truck and then tweeted about how upset I was with the universe.</description>
