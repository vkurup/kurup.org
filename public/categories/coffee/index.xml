      <description>Oh, in my last post, I forgot to mention one other cause we supported - The New York Botanical Gardens. I don&amp;rsquo;t really think of it as charity, since we definitely get our money&amp;rsquo;s worth of enjoyment out of the park. In addition, the gardens gave their members a gift this year - the Phillips Senseo Coffee Maker. This is one of those Pod coffee makers. You stick in a coffee-pod and the machine shoots boiling water through the pod and into your coffee mug.</description>
