      <description>So, I just talked with one of my best friends and learned that he still doesn&amp;rsquo;t read my blog. Devastating! We had an interesting conversation about how the value of &amp;lsquo;The Great Idea&amp;rsquo; can be overrated and I wanted to point him to this great essay about the same topic by Paul Graham. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how long it takes him to find it.
I enjoy most of Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s writings. He writes about startups and software, aimed at the high school/college age geek.</description>
