      <description>Thanks to Mala&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a lot more over the past month. Whenever I get into a good running rhythm, my mind starts to relax and I occasionally get bright ideas (believe it or not!). While I am running, these always seem Nobel Prize-worthy, but they seem to lose some of their glitter when the endorphins wear off. I still believe we could solve all the world&amp;rsquo;s problems if everyone was a runner.</description>
