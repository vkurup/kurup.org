      <description>Guess what, we&amp;rsquo;re composting now! I told you was going to be a gardener, so now you know I&amp;rsquo;m serious. For oh so many years, every Friday, we&amp;rsquo;d haul the garbage and recycling out and I&amp;rsquo;d think to myself, &amp;ldquo;Wow, we&amp;rsquo;d have like no garbage at all if we were composting.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s only taken a few years of thinking that, week in and week out, to get me to try. Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s not even true.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a gardener. Yup, just decided. Well, re-decided, I guess, since we already have a garden. It&amp;rsquo;s a strip of dirt on the side of our house and we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to grow vegetables the past couple years. But it has some problems. It&amp;rsquo;s way out of the way, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pain to check on it (since I&amp;rsquo;m lazy). The ground just underneath the topsoil is hard clay.</description>
