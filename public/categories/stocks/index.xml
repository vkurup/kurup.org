      <description>A friend asked for some investing advice a few years ago. Here was my response.
I have a feeling this is going to be long&amp;hellip; :-)
First thing - I don&amp;rsquo;t know your exact financial situation, but I know you&amp;rsquo;re in great shape for the long run. Anyone thinking this seriously about their finances this early in life will do fine. Also, since I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about your exact situation, this may be a little &amp;lsquo;condescending&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Blair Corp, a company in my portfolio, announced second quarter earnings today. They were disappointing, but not as disappointing as reported by bizjournals.
&amp;ldquo;Blair Corp. swings to loss&amp;rdquo; is the title of the article. While dramatic, it&amp;rsquo;s completely wrong.
 Blair Corp., a catalog clothing retailer and direct marketer, reported a loss in the second quarter as sales fell nearly 5 percent.
 False. They reported a profit of $233,000 in the second quarter.</description>
