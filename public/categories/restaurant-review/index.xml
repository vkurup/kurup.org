      <description>Louie and Ernie&amp;#39;s Pizza  We treated ourselves to our favorite New York Pizza today - Louie and Ernie&amp;rsquo;s. In my mind, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect pizza. The thin crust is crispy on the bottom, and chewy on the top. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of cheese and the sauce has some flavor. The only problem with this place is that it&amp;rsquo;s nowhere near public transportation and they don&amp;rsquo;t deliver. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a good thing though, or we&amp;rsquo;d be eating this ALL the time.</description>

      <description>It looks like a fish shack, but the service is much more attentive. We had clam chowder and crabcakes as appetizers, then the fish &amp;amp; chips and BLT tuna sandwich as entrees. The tuna was seared just on the edges. It was mixed with bacon, hard-boiled eggs, and avocado on fresh chewy bread. Mala says, &amp;ldquo;Best Tuna Fish sandwich ever,&amp;rdquo; and I can&amp;rsquo;t argue. All of the fried stuff was delicious and not too greasy.</description>
