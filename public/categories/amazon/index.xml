      <description>This seems useful.
 You are in a bookshop or a record shop. You find something that interests you. You can&amp;rsquo;t decide whether to buy it now or online later. What you need is a price check and a quick review, perhaps some ideas of something similar that others might recommend. Amabuddy can help!
 What you do is call (617) 712-3574 (There&amp;rsquo;s a 888 number as well, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be using a cell phone anyway).</description>
