      <description>Louie and Ernie&amp;#39;s Pizza  We treated ourselves to our favorite New York Pizza today - Louie and Ernie&amp;rsquo;s. In my mind, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect pizza. The thin crust is crispy on the bottom, and chewy on the top. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of cheese and the sauce has some flavor. The only problem with this place is that it&amp;rsquo;s nowhere near public transportation and they don&amp;rsquo;t deliver. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a good thing though, or we&amp;rsquo;d be eating this ALL the time.</description>

      <description>I had the commute from hell this morning. The 4 train went &amp;ldquo;Out of service&amp;rdquo; at 149th street, so we all got off and crowded onto the other nearly-full 4 train going downtown. They closed the doors for a minute, then opened the doors and said &amp;lsquo;This 4 is out of service&amp;rsquo;. So now there are 2 train-fulls of people trying to get to the 5 train downstairs. It was chaos.</description>
