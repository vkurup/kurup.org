      <description>Now that we have 3 kids, I&amp;rsquo;m always internally comparing one to the other. Sure that&amp;rsquo;s not healthy and will probably breed resentment in them during their teenage years, but what&amp;rsquo;s a bad parent to do?
I need an app that takes 2 kids&amp;rsquo; birthdays and then shows me what day it was when the older kid was the age that the younger kid is now. Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s a confusing sentence.</description>
