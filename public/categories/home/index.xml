      <description>I got 2 Nest E thermostats because Duke Energy was having a sale around Black Friday. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any strong motivation to have a Nest. The idea of a smart home is cool, but most &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; things nowadays have ended up being more work than benefit. Anyway, for $75 each, I thought it was worth a try. We have 2 thermostats so I decided to install the upstairs thermostat first.</description>
