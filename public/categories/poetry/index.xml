      <description>&amp;ldquo;Here it comes!&amp;rdquo; His eyes light up.
Slurps one last sip from his small cup.
Then bounding from the kitchen table,
Fast as lighting, he is able
To trash his scraps and stow his dishes.
He yells to Mom, &amp;ldquo;It was delicious!&amp;rdquo;
One more breath then on the couch he lands.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo; says Mom. Dad shrugs his hands.
Big brother also has no idea.
Big sister sighs, &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s a weird one I fear.</description>
