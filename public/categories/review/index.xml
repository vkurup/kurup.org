      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something about photography that seems to attract programmers. So many of the really good programmers that I know are also into photography. I, on the other hand, am just happy if my latest photo of the kids doesn&amp;rsquo;t include massive red eye. I&amp;rsquo;m always happy when a shot looks nice, but I know I&amp;rsquo;m not interested enough to be an exceptional photographer. I&amp;rsquo;ve never wanted a fancy SLR camera because I know I&amp;rsquo;d leave it on the shelf collecting dust.</description>

      <description>Can you believe that it&amp;rsquo;s been a year since we got married? Me neither. For our wedding, Mike and Ellie gave us a generous gift certificate to the bed &amp;amp; breakfast of our choice. It took a while to find the right one. We started at bedandbreakfast.com and surfed dozens of listings. This industry really needs some web consulting advice. Most B&amp;amp;B websites don&amp;rsquo;t provide nearly enough information. I want more photos, more reviews.</description>
