      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not an OS X programmer, but I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed 2 recent episodes of the NSBrief podcast. First was Mark Dalrymple&amp;rsquo;s interview. Here was my 140 character description:
So much geeky fun in @borkware&amp;rsquo;s interview. AOLserver, dtrace, OpenDoc, MPW, need I go on? nsbrief.com/59-mark-dalrymâ€¦
&amp;mdash; Vinod Kurup (@vkurup) August 16, 2012 
Today, I listened to Mark Aufflick&amp;rsquo;s interview where he talks eloquently about starting your own business. I love the perspective he had on his first business and how shutting it down gave him the necessary (though painful) experience to make his current business work.</description>

      <title>Automated Testing Rules</title>

      <description>Automated testing is a good thing. For my running log application, I have a proc that creates a new log for a user, called rl::runner::new. If you happen to call it for a user who already has a log, it returns the already created log. When I created the proc way back when, I also created an automated test to make sure that creation worked and that redundant calls returned the orignal log.</description>

      <description>Linux Journal featured an article about a web application written in OpenACS. It&amp;rsquo;s called Fungoes and it tabulates and formats baseball statistics. If I had access to this app when I was a kid, I would&amp;rsquo;ve been in heaven. I remember spending hours and hours memorizing stats from the back of baseball cards. I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten most of what I memorized, but I can still rattle off HR stats for most of the 1982 Brewers.</description>

      <description>I built a web application to keep track of my running a couple years ago. I really began using it in earnest during my training for the New York Marathon last year. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to make it available for others to use for a long time, but it always seemed like there was a little more work I needed to do on it. While working on it the other day, I noticed the original timestamp on one of the source files: September 21, 2003 Yikes!</description>

      <title>Prettier permalinks</title>

      <description>Permalink stands for &amp;lsquo;permanent link&amp;rsquo;. When you create a blog post, it gets added to the top of your blog, pushing older entries down. Eventually, posts get pushed off the front page, so it&amp;rsquo;s important that you have a way to refer to old blog posts. A permalink is the link that will always point to a specific post.
OpenACS (lars-blogger) permalinks look like this:
http://kurup.org/blog/one-entry?entry_id=58950  This works and it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to code, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give much information about the content or date of the post.</description>

      <title>Tcl, a short introduction</title>

      <description>The scripting language used in most of OpenACS is Tcl. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t receive a lot of press. When people talk about scripting languages, they mean Perl or Python (and now Ruby). Tcl is not considered in the same category, but it should be. I&amp;rsquo;m not smart enough to explain why, but Salvatore Sanfilippo is and has written a gentle introduction to both the basic and powerful features of Tcl.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting around to moving my blog into the Web 1.5 world. (2.0 minus javascript). I scrapped the categories system and created a super-simple tags package. So, now I can tag posts and technorati can find them. OpenACS barely lights up on technorati. Compare RubyOnRails (20 mentions per day) with OpenACS (1 mention in the past month!). I know Rails is popular, but is OpenACS completely dead? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so.</description>

      <description>I created a very simple blog application using the OpenACS Content Repository (CR). When I say simple, I mean simple, probably to the point of being useless. I just wanted to try writing something as quickly as possible using the CR. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick run-through of the code, in case it might help someone else understand how to use the CR. I&amp;rsquo;m not including much commentary; email me (or comment) if you&amp;rsquo;d like me to expound more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned Darwinports before. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to (minimally) documenting my Darwinports OpenACS installation. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite 1-click installation, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting closer.</description>

      <description>In the process of installing Panther from scratch, I decided to use DarwinPorts. It&amp;rsquo;s a packaging system for the abundant UNIX free software available on Mac OS X. I had previously used Fink which, while being an admirable project, seemed a little opaque to me. I never quite knew where data was being installed and which locations were being searched to see if prerequisites were present. Darwinports seems to be a little better at finding programs/libraries that are already installed.</description>

Unfortunately, the OpenFTS Makefile and configure scripts aren&amp;rsquo;t standard, so I had to muck around with things alot. Here&amp;rsquo;s the diff:

      <description>Installing OpenACS via Darwinports by Vinod Kurup
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a Darwinports installation for OpenACS. (What is Darwinports?). This will allow you to set up a quick test installation to try out OpenACS. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it for a production (or even a development) server. For those purposes, I&amp;rsquo;d strictly follow the OpenACS documentation.
Download my OpenACS portfiles and stick them in your local darwinports repository. If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a local darwinports repository, create one and add its location to /opt/local/etc/ports/sources.</description>

      <description>I upgraded to OpenACS 5 thanks to instructions from DaveB, et. al. I had a few hitches with that process, but the system seems to be working OK and is certainly zippier. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested everything out yet, so please holler if anything breaks.</description>

      <description>This site was down for the past few days due to a SNAFU with acornhosting&amp;rsquo;s upstream provider. You&amp;rsquo;d think I&amp;rsquo;d have learned to have a backup strategy in place by now, but you&amp;rsquo;d be overestimating my intelligence. Luckily, Cathy was somehow able to negotiate with her failed upstream provider to get my (and other acornhosting customers&amp;rsquo;) data back. After this episode, I promise to backup religiously and I&amp;rsquo;m even more sold on acornhosting as a solid web hosting provider.</description>

      <description>MarkD informed me that unregistered users couldn&amp;rsquo;t add comments. Turns out it was due to some extra quoting of query variables that has been fixed in more recent versions of OpenACS, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been too lazy to update. The good news is that all of you who&amp;rsquo;ve been dying to tell me off can finally do so!
Comments from old site Maybe they should register
 You shouldn&#39;t have fixed the problem these people should take the time to register with your site and become part of one the coolest communities on the web.</description>

      <description>Bhavesh responded to my seemingly irrational exuberance about OpenACS asking, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the excitement about OpenACS?&amp;rdquo;
There are much better answers to this question, starting with Why OpenACS?, by my web host Cathy Sarisky, but here&amp;rsquo;s my super brief answer.
OpenACS is a toolkit to build online communities, that is, sites which value users and their contributions. OpenACS provides applications which allow users to create and manage content - applications like forums, photo albums, blogs, calendars, wikis, and file storage areas.</description>

      <description>Forget MTV. I want my OpenACS! So, I finally got around to install OpenACS on my Powerbook. Mostly, I just followed MarkD&amp;rsquo;s excellent directions, but I used tDom and AOLserver 4, so there were a few differences.
Comments from old site OpenACS
 Vinod...what is the excitment about OpenACS? I went to the website, but couldn&#39;t get a clear idea of what it&#39;s differentiating features are. Are you running OpenACS for this website?</description>

      <description>Another Mac OS X OpenACS Installation Guide by Vinod Kurup
I installed OpenACS 5.0 on my PowerBook G4. Everyone should read MarkD&amp;rsquo;s guide since it&amp;rsquo;s more comprehensive and explains a lot of the changes that I don&amp;rsquo;t explain. I used some different software versions which made my experience different enough to document.
This is a quick and dirty document for people who have installed OpenACS 4. If I haven&amp;rsquo;t been clear enough or if I&amp;rsquo;ve made mistakes, please let me know.</description>

 Make sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve committed all the local changes that I&amp;rsquo;ve made.
vinod:~$ cd web/kurup vinod:~/web/kurup$ cvs commit -m &amp;ldquo;Fixed foo, bar and blah&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Not all of OpenACS is Postgres 7.3 compliant yet. OpenACS 5 is compliant and the core packages in OpenACS 4.6 are compliant, but some non-core packages haven&amp;rsquo;t been fixed yet. Noncompliant packages will complain:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m slowly in the process of moving my site from PHP/MySQL to OpenACS. Things are broken in the meantime. Specifically, I need to import all my old photos, steal MarkD&amp;rsquo;s book module, and implement my family-tree module. If you find something that&amp;rsquo;s broken, feel free to let me know.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently using an open-source stylesheet from The NYPL, but I need to edit it at some point. But for now, at least, it looks better than anything I could drum up by myself.</description>
