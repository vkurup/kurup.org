      <description>One of my favorite podcasts is going on hiatus. (A podcast is basically a fancy word for a radio show that you can download to your MP3 player.) Talking History is produced by the Organization of American Historians and because of budget problems, they cutting funding for Talking History.
The host Brian LeBeau is the epitome of a great interviewer. He mostly stays in the background, giving the stage to the historian, but when he asks a question, you immediately feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a question that you would want to ask.</description>
