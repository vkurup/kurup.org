      <description>I use kino to edit the videos that we take of the kids. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a Linux program which was as nice as iMovie was on the Mac, but kino is pretty good. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to splice and reconnect video clips together. It has nice special effects, though my needs are pretty simple. It&amp;rsquo;s able to export in plenty of formats, possibly too many, for my simple mind. But, I&amp;rsquo;ve figured it out and have a stable process for getting video from camera to youtube.</description>
