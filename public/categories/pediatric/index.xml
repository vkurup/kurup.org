      <description>Mala finishes her fellowship in July 2007, so we&amp;rsquo;ve entered job search mode. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a few interviews scheduled, but it just seems harder than it should be to find out who has positions available.
Some criteria:
 focus on clinical practice location with a lower cost of living than NYC (I guess that rules out &amp;hellip; NYC) friendly colleagues, staff, environment family friendly location near friends or family  So if you know of someone that needs hard-working, intelligent, caring pediatric endocrinologist, let me know.</description>
