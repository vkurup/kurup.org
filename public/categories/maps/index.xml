      <description>I admit it. As a runner, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessive about my mileage. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m obsessive about running and getting my mileage in. That would be a good thing. Once I do go for a run, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessive about knowing exactly how far I&amp;rsquo;ve run.
In high school, I&amp;rsquo;d finish my run and then promptly jump on my 10-speed bike which had an odometer, so I could measure how far I&amp;rsquo;d gone.</description>

      <description>Wow Google Maps is really cool. You can drag the maps around. How cool is that? Put in a location, then drag the map so that the location that you put in is just off the map. Then click the little red signpost on the right hand column and google rescrolls so that your location is back on the map. Very nice!
