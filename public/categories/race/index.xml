      <description>I did something yesterday that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before. I took a ride on the subway from one end all the way to the other end. I took the D train from 205th street in the Bronx to Coney Island/Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn, passing through Manhattan on the way. Left at 6:04 AM and arrived at 7:46 AM, just in time to make it to the start of the Brooklyn Half Marathon.</description>

      <title>Brooklyn Half Marathon</title>

      <description>It was cold out there today. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, a headband and gloves, and I was still cold. I doubted whether I&amp;rsquo;d be able to break 2 hours, like I&amp;rsquo;d hoped. A mile into the race I was sure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to do it. It felt like I was just running in place. As usual though, I eventually warmed up and felt pretty good.</description>

      <description>I ran the NYRR Hot Chocolate 15K (9.3 miles) this morning. It was cold, but then again, it&amp;rsquo;s the middle of December, so whaddya expect? I&amp;rsquo;ve only run twice since the marathon, so I took it nice and easy. I planned to run about 10 minute miles, but I felt good around mile 5, so I sped up. I finished in 1:25:22 (9:10 per mile).
Oh yeah&amp;hellip; and the Hot Chocolate was awesome!</description>

      <description>The marathon is tomorrow. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty nervous. I really want to break 5 hours this time. You can track me online at the NY Marathon site. I&amp;rsquo;ll be runner number 27072.
UPDATE 2005-11-14:
I finished in 4:28:09 (chip time). I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with my time and the whole experience. Running down 4th avenue in Brooklyn was crowded, but just breathtaking. You could see a river of people for what seemed like miles ahead.</description>

      <description>I ran the Bronx Half-Marathon on Sunday in 2:07:05. I ran the same race last year in 2:07:02. How&amp;rsquo;s that for consistent?. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be consistently fast than consistently slow, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to look on the bright side. By the way, I really do enjoy these races more than my pictures would suggest :-)
We started near Lehman College and ran along beautiful tree-lined streets like Sedgwick Avenue and Mosholu Parkway.</description>

      <title>First Race of the Year</title>

      <description>Fred Lebow Classic
I&amp;rsquo;ve run about 10 miles in the past 2 months, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting anything great on Sunday. My conservative goal was 50 minutes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t set any other goals.
I got to the start a little late and didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to find the baggage area, so I strapped on my backpack and ran with it. This made it feel even more like a training run, rather than a race.</description>

      <description>I ran 2 more half-marathons in the past couple weeks. I ran Greta&amp;rsquo;s Great Gallop on October 3rd in Central Park and then ran the Staten Island Half Marathon today.
  Date Race Miles Time Pace (min/mile)   October 3 Greta&#39;s Gallop 13.1 1:46:42 8:08   October 17 Staten Island 13.1 1:41:56 7:47   I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy about these 2 races. The weather was perfect and I was able to avoid hitting the wall.</description>

      <title>Fitness Magazine 4 mile run</title>

      <description>I ran the Fitness Magazine 4 mile race in Central Park last weekend. The remnants of Hurricane Ivan were flooding the streets, so I was certain that the race would be cancelled (or that I would chicken out). Neither happened as the sky cleared 10 minutes before the race started.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t warm up as much as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked, but the first 2 miles went suprisingly well (7:11, 7:16). The hills on mile 3 killed me (7:51), but I was able to pick it up at the end (7:29).</description>

      <title>My Summer Racing Results</title>

      <description>I ran 5 more races this summer in my quest to automatically qualify for next year&amp;rsquo;s New York Marathon. The Fifth Avenue Mile was a breakthrough run for me. I easily outdid my pre-race goal of breaking 7 minutes and came within 40 seconds of my best time ever (5:07 fifteen years ago). This makes me think that I might be able to break 4 hours in the marathon next year if I train properly.</description>

      <title>Queens Half</title>

      <description>I ran the Queens Half-Marathon on Saturday in 2:11:25. That&amp;rsquo;s about 10 minute miles for 13.1 hot humid miles. It was especially fun because my parents were here visiting from Wisconsin and I think this is the first time they saw me run. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how much of a boost that gave me.</description>

      <description>I ran two more races this past week - the Race to Deliver 4 mile in Central Park on Sunday and the Turkey Trot 5 mile in Prospect Park yesterday. The Race to Deliver was crowded with 6000 or so other runners and I spent most of the first half of the race just swerving around everyone else. I never quite got into a groove, but I was still able to finish in 32:34.</description>

      <description>I ran the NYRR Cross Country Championships this AM in 26:48 for 5K. My last cross country race was 15 years ago as a senior in high school. Wow, writing that sentence makes me feel old :-) In those days, I could run 5K in 19 minutes easily and I thought that 7 minute miles were slow. Ahh, to be young again! The NYRR run is held at Van Cortland Park, a beautiful oasis in the Bronx and the race starts out deceptively flat.</description>

      <title>The Wall is not a myth</title>

      <description>I ran the Marine Corps Marathon yesterday and can now confirm that Hitting the Wall is a real phenomenon. I finished about 5 minutes faster than I did in Chicago (2000), but I was really hoping to break 4:30. Everything was going great through the halfway point (2:11:48 - 10:04 mpm) when a few doubts started to creep into my head. I&amp;rsquo;m only halfway? I gotta do this again? Somehow I was able to make it through to mile 17 at 2:55:30 (10:19 mpm) before things really fell apart.</description>

      <description>My cousin Deepu and I (plus about 30,000 or so other people) ran the Chicago Marathon. Cross that off my life&amp;rsquo;s to-do list!</description>
