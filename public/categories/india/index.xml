      <description>I briefly mentioned finding the 2012 UCLA lecture series, &amp;ldquo;History of Indian Civilization&amp;rdquo;, a couple days ago. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through and have found it thorougly illuminating. I learned a lot about India growing up, but never in a formal way, so it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have someone as skilled as Vinay Lal connect all the loose threads into a coherent history. One of the things that surprises me is that aside from the fact that classes are being streamed over the internet, there is nothing different than the lectures I skipped (I mean religiously attended!</description>

      <description>vaishnodevi  I was fortunate to take a trip with my in-laws to India last month. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to uploading the pics, but as I look at them now, they don&amp;rsquo;t quite capture the amount of amazing stuff that we saw. I took about 400 pictures and uploaded 187 here. You&amp;rsquo;d think 400 pics would adequately capture a trip, but not for a trip to India.
Here are some interesting ones in case you don&amp;rsquo;t want to wade through 15 pages of pics.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to write about my trip to India, but since I&amp;rsquo;m the biggest procastinator in the world, I have a feeling that might not happen. Suffice it to say that Mala and I had a blast visiting our families and taking in some amazing sights. Thanks to everyone there for taking such great care of us. Without further delay, go look at some photos:

      <description>Reported in the New York Times: (free registration required)
 One of the most respected Jewish authorities in the ultra-Orthodox world, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, issued the Indian hair ban from Israel on Wednesday, prompting some people in Israel to create lists of stores selling banned wigs and to burn Indian wigs in bonfires, according to Ha&amp;rsquo;aretz, an Israeli newspaper.
 This sounds like a story from the The Onion</description>

      <description>Today is the 56th anniversary of India&amp;rsquo;s Independence from Britain. Interestingly, Google&amp;rsquo;s top results for &amp;ldquo;indian independence day&amp;rdquo; are not very informative - mostly just greeting card sites.</description>

      <description>My parents and I went to India for 2 weeks. We spent a couple days in Delhi and then the rest of the time in Kerala. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and actually found the vacation relaxing. Kerala is more beautiful than I ever remember (somehow I seem to forget in between trips). It&amp;rsquo;s lush and green and the food is amazing. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go back. Here are some pics.</description>
