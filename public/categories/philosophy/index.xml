      <description>Time for some pop philosophy. I&amp;rsquo;ve never thought too deeply about the concept of free will. Of course we have free will! I chose to live my life a certain way. I could choose to live a different way. It is my free will to choose how I live. I&amp;rsquo;ve never thought about it more deeply than that.
I recently read Walter Isaacson&amp;rsquo;s biography of Einstein and I was forced to think more deeply about free will.</description>
