      <description>Every year, Google does an analysis of search queries over the past year. They call it the Google Zeitgeist. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how &amp;lsquo;what we search for&amp;rsquo; is a very accurate historical record of our times. The Apple iPod takes up 4 of the top 10 searches on Froogle, Google&amp;rsquo;s consumer search engine.
If you liked Zeitgeist, you can monitor weekly updates.</description>

      <description>Bad news! My Powerbook G3 went kaput yesterday. After a day or so of troubleshooting, I&amp;rsquo;m blaming it on a dead Power Management Unit. I bought it used in 1999 and have been using it heavily since. It&amp;rsquo;s lived in 7 apartments with me (yup, 7!) from Boston to Green Bay to Minneapolis to Boston (again!) and now to NYC. I still think that 4-5 years is way too short a lifespan for a computer, especially since it was meeting my needs in every other way.</description>
