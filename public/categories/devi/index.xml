 Dear Vinu Mamman,
I visited your page and you didn&amp;rsquo;t put a picture of me. I am really mad at you because you didn&amp;rsquo;t give me a picture. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you put a picture of me? If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a picture of me, I could send you one. Everybody else have a picture of them. If you have a picture you can put it on your computer.</description>
