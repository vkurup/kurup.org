      <description>Has anyone tried any of the Internet phone services? Skype looks very interesting. Nice interface, lots of platforms, high praise from people I trust, and most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s FREE! Well, as long as the person you&amp;rsquo;re calling also has Skype. If you want to call a real phone, you buy credits (which seem pretty cheap). Lemme know if any of you try it out&amp;hellip;
