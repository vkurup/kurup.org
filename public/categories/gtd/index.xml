      <title>Priorities and GTD</title>

      <description>Pre-GTD task management systems recommended that you assign a priority to each task. When looking at a list of tasks, you then choose the ones with the highest priority. David Allen (author of GTD) includes &amp;lsquo;priority&amp;rsquo; as one of the things that you should consider when you are deciding what to do, but only after you have considered context, time available, and energy available. Which makes sense. As Merlin Mann says, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if mowing your lawn is your highest priority when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting in an airplane.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Merlin Mann&amp;rsquo;s recent series of podcasts on GTD, I&amp;rsquo;m getting back on the GTD wagon (for about the 100th time). I read Getting Things Done in 2002 and have been trying to implement it ever since. I&amp;rsquo;ve had periods where I followed it religiously for a month at a time, but it&amp;rsquo;s never completely stuck. From what I hear, this is normal and I accept it now. This won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time that I restart GTD.</description>
