      <description>All I could think of while watching the news about the supercomputer Watson beating humans at Jeopardy was how this could be used in medicine. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;m not alone.
Time to start looking for a new job?</description>

      <description>Russ Feingold lost his U.S. Senate race. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been following Wisconsin politics since I left 14 years ago, but this makes me sad. The last time that I really cared about the U.S. political landscape was 1992. I was 21 and in college at the University of Wisconsin and was voting for the first time. Bill Clinton was generating excitement, especially on college campuses, but I was more interested in Russ Feingold&amp;rsquo;s campaign.</description>
